    <Description>[H4]Delvin Constructs HNG F304 Modular Hanger/Motor Pool[h4]
Setting up one modular base structure requires an [B]Easy ([DI]) Athletics check[b] and roughly 2 hours of narrative time.
[P]These facilities usually take the form of simple buildings with an open floor area; a large. lockable bay door wide enough for vehicles to easily move through; and two smaller entry doors. They can hold a number of vehicles with a combined silhouette of 12 and no single vehicle larger than silhouette 4. Each also includes a full set of mechanics' tools (allowing characters to perform Mechanics checks to heal droids or repair vehicles or starships without penalty), and an oil bath for droids. When used to repair starships or vehicles stored inside, the character repairs 1 additional hull trauma or 2 additional system strain on a successful check.
[P]If purchased multiple times. they can be used as separate vehicle storage facilities. Alternatively, up to two additional units may be combined together with the original one to increase the silhouette limit by 10 per additional unit (although the maximum single vehicle size remains at Silhouette 4).</Description>
