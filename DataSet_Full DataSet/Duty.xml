      [H4]Combat Victory[h4]

The Player Character is driven to show that the Alliance can hold its own against Imperial forces in any troop vs. troop engagement. He wants to engage the Empire's military—their best, whenever possible—and provide more victories for the Alliance to tout to the galaxy as proof it can ultimately win the war. This means daring raids, excellent tactics, and acquiring the best firepower possible.</Description>

The PC knows that the survival of the Alliance depends upon its ability to hide from the Empire and avoid complete destruction at the hands of its overwhelming military superiority. To this end, he wants to hunt down and eliminate enemy agents and threats, feed false information to Imperial intelligence networks, and cover the movements of all Alliance assets from observation and reporting.</Description>

The PC knows that every victory hinges on knowing as much about the Empire's military might and other assets as possible. He is driven to gather any and all potentially useful data, wishing to locate vital and vulnerable targets for Rebellion forces to strike at. He not only wants to know what the Imperial military factions are up to, but also the state of technological research, economic policies, and other aspects of Imperial strength.

The most dangerous threat to the Alliance comes from within its own ranks. Any Rebel soldier, operative, or ally could be an insidious threat waiting to take an action at a critical moment to bring entire operations crashing down, costing lives and assets. Knowing that vigilance against these threats is the truest form of devotion to the cause of the Alliance, the PC watches for any and all signs of betrayal.</Description>

More than machines, credits, or information, the people of the Alliance are the most important and vital assets there are, and the Player Character knows this. He is devoted to seeing to their safety, well-being, and capacity for success. No one should ever be left behind; the most successful missions might not achieve every goal, but they are successful nonetheless when no one dies.</Description>

Every blaster, starfighter, and thermal detonator in the galaxy is useless without the political will to truly challenge and overthrow Palpatine and his New Order. The Player Character understands this all too well and is determined to see to it that as many factions, systems, and sectors as possible come to the side—and the aid—of the Alliance against the Empire.</Description>

Every engagement with the Empire is a war of attrition, and that is a war the Rebellion simply cannot win. Nonetheless, more people must be found to serve, and they are needed in every capacity. Not only does the Alliance military need more soldiers and pilots, it needs more technicians, engineers, mechanics, scientists, doctors, slicers. and just about every other kind of worker. This Player Character understands the risks of recruitment, as well as the needs, and is constantly on the lookout for allies who are both talented and trustworthy.</Description>

There are never enough supplies to fully support those fighting against the juggernaut that is the Empire, and this PC knows it very well. He is determined to seek out new sources of raw materials, food, clothing, weapons, armor, and equipment of all kinds. One spare crate of medpacs can save quite a few lives, and a handful of comlinks can mean the difference between success and failure on a mission. He will trade, beg, borrow, and steal anything for the cause.

The largest and most powerful military force in the history of the galaxy is also the most vulnerable to acts of destruction and asset denial. The character is focused on disrupting Imperial operations in any way possible, whether it's the manufacture of weapons, troop movements, supply shipments, banking systems, or any other key operation, in order to make the Empire act more slowly and less capably. Truly showy acts of destruction also work to erode a population's will to support the Empire, or so the PC often believes (though the Alliance expressly forbids actual acts of terrorism).

As the Combat Victory-driven PC feels about troop conflicts, so this Player Character feels about ship-to-ship combat and naval engagements. To him, the war will ultimately be decided in the stars, and what the Alliance lacks in sheer numbers, it more than makes up for in the quality and tenacity of its pilots. Every single space battle is an opportunity to show the rest of the galaxy that the Alliance not only can win the war, but is destined to do so.

There is no more prolific or productive time for technological developments than during a war, and this one is no exception. This Player Character sees the true opportunity for Alliance victory in the hands of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Not only can they get the most performance from existing machines and resources, but they can design and develop new ships, weapons, medical techniques, and equipment that can provide the vital edge necessary to survive against the Empire's might. The way this PC sees it, stealing the best developments of the Empire is a crucial way to even the odds.</Description>

This PC is devoted to helping fellow Rebels fulfill their Duties by providing whatever assistance they need.

This PC seeks out the most skilled and famous Imperials on the battlefield, and takes them out head on. These duels are often recorded and released on shadowfeeds as a part of Rebel propaganda efforts to showcase how vulnerable the Empire is to Rebel assaults. Whether the PC sees this Duty as a means of testing himself or a way to help larger Rebel efforts, he is likely to be seen abandoning his mission objectives if a tempting enough target is fleeing the scene.</Description>

If not for Rebels focused on maintaining tech superiority, the Alliance never would have acquired X-wings, or created the A-wing or B-wing starfighters.

    <Description>
      [H4]Rebel Base[h4]
[P]If a campaign is centered around a Rebel Base, then, at the CM’s discretion, one or more of the characters may choose to have a Rebel Base be his Duty. This Duty behaves much like any other, and the CM can use the following as guidance for how to reflect it in the story. If multiple characters choose to have this be their Duty (or one of them, anyway), the CM should consider condensing it into a group Duty. A group Duty is tracked cumulatively. Whenever a group Duty triggers, it counts as triggering for all characters who share in it.
Generally, when one or more characters' Rebel Base Duty triggers, the narrative events should relate to that facility and its inhabitants. [P]At times, this could be relatively mundane. The bonus to the PCs’ wound thresholds might come from the base staff recognizing their hard work or even doing something special to make the team more at home. Alternatively, when it triggers, it might mean that the story focuses on the base itself in some way. Perhaps the base comes under attack, for instance, and
the PCs’ increased wound thresholds represent their desire to protect their home. Much like any other Duty, a Rebel Base Duty provides the CM with plenty of narrative hooks.
[P]Alternatively or in addition to any narrative ramifications, the GM can use the Rebel Base Duty triggering to offer the PCs chances to upgrade their stronghold. If the PCs are at the base, this could mean that an opportunity comes to them. Perhaps a smuggler reaches the base, offering to trade various important supplies for protection from bounty hunters, or a group of fresh recruits arrives and the PCs must train them to work as support staff and soldiers on the base. If this Duty triggers while the PCs are off-base, it might mean that they runs across a unique chance to improve the base, recruit a new staff member, or get much-needed supplies. At the GM’s discretion, when the Rebel base Duty triggers, the GM can offer the PCs an opportunity to acquire one of the base upgrades found on pages 88-89 without paying the normal price in credits for it.

Ensuring that their troops are as safe as possible under battlefield conditions is these Commanders'
primary concern. They never send their troops into hopeless situations in which defeat is certain, preferring instead to
preserve their unit’s strength for meaningful battles if sacrifices must be made. If taken too far, this ideology can result
in weak commanding officers who lose ground because they aren’t even willing to try. They may gain a reputation for
cowardice, which harms both discipline and their own chances for advancement.</Description>

Each fighting unit is a family of sorts, and this is equally true within the ranks of the Alliance military. These
Commanders seek to bring the troops together in a way that fosters trust, respect, and pride. By fostering the bonds that
develop between comrades in combat, Commanders are able to strengthen morale and drive their people to fight harder
and better than other, similar units. Unfortunately, camaraderie can have unfortunate results—alienation from fellow units,
instances of hazing and initiation within the ranks, and overconfidence in the face of overwhelming odds.</Description>

Undermining enemies' psychological ability to wage war is just as important as defeating them in
battle. Commanders realize this, and do their best to ensure that the Empire suffers every defeat on a psychological level.
By fostering a unit's notoriety, a Commanders can ensure that that its reputation precedes it among the enemy, thereby
weakening the enemy’s resolve before a fight even begins. Once a battle is won, a Commander must ensure that the enemy
knows it’s been soundly beaten, though the Commander must take care not to resort to the Empire's brand of brutality.

By attacking this vulnerable and often- overlooked Imperial resource, such PCs provide vital aid to the Rebel Alliance.</Description>

Deceivers know their own kind. PCs with this Duty focus on protecting the Alliance from moles, double agents, and traitors. They also help maintain safety by ensuring that strongholds, outposts, and safe houses remain undetected by the Empire.

Even the most skilled Rebel agent can be captured and subjected to Imperial interrogation. PCs with this Duty specialize in ensuring that they and their fellow Rebels have the physical and mental fortitude to endure interrogation. They also work to ensure that information critical to the Alliance is compartmentalized and secure, so that agents who are unable to resist Imperial questioning don't compromise the entire Rebellion.</Description>

PCs selecting this Duty work to create fictitious histories and evidence to back up an infiltrating Spy's cover identity. Known as legends, these false histories help Spies assume a cover identity that becomes a fully realized person and can be easily presented to others. These efforts usually also include planting falsified information or doctored holos into Imperial databases, so that anyone researching the Spy's cover identity will find a host of data that corroborates the legend, enough to pass rigorous examination.</Description>

Fear is not only the purview of the Empire. PCs with this Duty attempt to spread fear among enemy forces in an effort to weaken morale and destroy the discipline that is the hallmark of the Imperial Army and Navy. They also regularly combat Imperial propaganda and look within the ranks of the Empire itself for personnel who might easily be swayed into joining the Rebellion. </Description>

Wars are sometimes won before a battle is ever fought.

PCs with this Duty know that sometimes questionable, if not downright immoral, acts must be committed in the name of the greater good. The quiet death of a single key individual, after all, can save many lives or keep important secrets buried for good. They're willing to do the unthinkable for the cause, and eliminate or assassinate critical Imperial personnel to prevent or undo a greater evil.</Description>
