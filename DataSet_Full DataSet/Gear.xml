    [H3]Comlink (handheld)[h3]

A common device found across the galaxy, comlinks come in a variety of forms depending on their function and user. Each allows for audio messaging between two parties though advanced models can transmit multiple users or network groups together. Personal comlinks are often small, hand-held cylinders capable of communicating over distances into low orbit. Some models are built into helmets and armor segments. Longer-range versions are usually carried as large satchels or in backpacks, and can reach across a planet and to ships in high orbit (or even elsewhere in the same star system). Most operate on a standard net of frequencies that can be adjusted as desired to elude detection.</Description>

      [H3]Synthetic Standard Neurotoxin[h3]

This is a general poison synthetically produced on hundreds of worlds (often illegally) that affects the biochemical reactions of most creatures, sometimes fatally. This poison may be introduced into the target's body via aerosol deployment, food ingestion, or injection (via an applicator or dart). Resisting a single dose has an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) difficulty[b], while two or more doses combined into a single application have a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) difficulty[b]. The poison inflicts 5 wounds if the target fails the check. Each [TH] generated inflicts one strain on the target as the effort of fighting the poison overwhelms him. Finally, the GM can spend [DE] to make the target test against the poison again during the next round, as the poison remains in his system.</Description>

This poison may be introduced into a target's body via aerosol deployment, food ingestion, or injection (via an applicator or dart). A single dose has an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) difficulty[b], while two or more doses combined into a single application have a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) difficulty[b]. The poison inflicts 5 strain if the target fails the check. If the check generates one to two [TH], the target must also give up his free maneuver during his next turn (he may still take two maneuvers, however); if it generates [TH][TH][TH] or more, he's staggered during his next turn.

It took six designs before the weaponsmiths at BlasTech achieved success, but the Mod VII, also known as a "blaster arm," finally combined a realistic limb with a deadly ranged weapon. The company uses outsourced cybernetic limbs as the basis for their designs, modifying them with their own proprietary weapon designs to form the final product. Favored by bounty hunters and assassins, the artificial forearm can split open for a short-ranged blaster to spring out and deliver a hail of shots before most foes are aware they are in danger. 

[P]The standard cybernetic weapon arm appears to be a regular cybernetic arm but features a retractable light blaster pistol that can be deployed as an incidental. It is attached to the arm and cannot be removed, dropped, or disarmed.

      [H3]General Purpose Scanner[h3]

Most scanners are small, hand-held gear, designed to be simple and durable for field use by scouts and explorers. Depending on the model, they indicate the nearby presence of life forms, heat fonts, radiation sources, acoustic emissions, or any combination thereof. Some operate in all directions, displaying their results on screens or holo-displays, while others are directional and only give indications towards where they are pointing. The Cryoncorp EnhanceScan is a typical example of this. Small enough to be carried by a single scout, the scanner has life-form tracking, motion sensing, metal detection, and the ability to intercept standard frequency comlink transmissions. The motion sensing operates up to half a kilometer, while the remaining systems can detect targets up to a kilometer and a half, and the comlink interceptor can catch signals from much further.

"Hand scanner" is a catchall designation for a wide variety of handheld scanning devices designed to run specific-purpose scans. Some of the most common versions of these are medisensors, such as the RFX/K Medisensor made by BioTech Industries. The device can be used independently or plugged into a medpac or datapad, and displays a variety of useful bio-signs about the subject. Other scanners can check for atmospheric contaminants, poisons, vermin, or in the case of mechanics, micro-fractures or stress points.

These small (less than three centimeters across) beacons are commonly placed on their target via darts or other surreptitious means, where they use adhesion or magnetism to stay affixed. Once in place, they relay information such as location, direction, and rate of movement to their user, making them invaluable for tracking an unwitting foe. The most expensive models, such as the Rhinsome Tracking Corp SureSnoop, can relay information through obstructions over dozens of kilometers, while the cheaper Astroserver Industries Rover and Trailmaster and the MechBlaze Observer tend to have much shorter broadcast ranges and can be blocked by large buildings or thick masses of rock or metal.

Medpacs are common even on those ships that do not engage in activities of dubious legality, for even those with little medical training can use the contents to treat injuries and save lives. Most ships carry several, and they are a common component in most survival gear. Standard medpacs contain field dressings, bacta patches, basic drugs, antiseptics, medical tools and knives, blood coagulators, synthflesh applicators, and more, all designed for ease of use and fast patient stabilization. The GLiS (General Life-Sustaining) also has a limited diagnostic scanner to monitor a patient's vital signs, and a computer that can provide treatment options. The intention of this medpac is to allow for basic first aid in the field. 

[P]Medpacs allow characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty, as detailed on page 219.

The medpac carries instruments for emergency field surgery, a better diagnostic computer and mediscanner, advanced synth-nutrient replicators for sustaining a patient's vital nutrients, spray splints, and counter-radiation and biological poison drugs. 

[P]This medpac allows the user to perform relatively complicated medical procedures in the field, and can rival the infirmaries on smaller starships. It allows characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty as described on page 219, and additionally grants a [BO] on all attempts. In addition, the internal stim storage grants the user the equivalent of one stimpack per scene (although the GM can rule the device has run out of stims if the supplies are used continuously).

[P]It takes a maneuver for a character to inject a stimpack in himself or another..Stimpacks are one-use items, and automatically heal 5 wounds. Characters can use stimpacks more than once, but each use heals one less wound (so the second use heals four, the third use heals three, and so on). The sixth stimpack heals no wounds—the character is already oversaturated with the medicine for it to have any effect. It takes a day for the character's body to process the stimpacks and for him to be able to use them at full effectiveness. See page 220 for more information.

Where there are people wishing to communicate, there are people wishing to prevent it, and thus there are jammers. Smaller versions can shut out local signals, while others are so powerful as to cut entire planets off from the rest of the galaxy. The Miradyne "Hail" is one of the former, a relatively portable device that can blanket standard comlink frequencies over a quarter-kilometer radius. It can also focus on a single target (such as an individual building) from up to three kilometers away. 

[P]Cutting through the noise created by a comm jammer requires a Computers check, with a difficulty proportional to the distance from the jammer and the power of the device. The closer and more powerful the jammer, the harder the difficulty. The "Hail" forces an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) check[b], which becomes more difficult at close ranges (the exact difficulty is up to the GM, but should increase to Hard or Daunting if at medium range or closer to the device).

Electronic lock breakers like those made by the fancifully named OutlawTech (a group of slicers and criminal technicians) are automatic anti-security slicing systems that can hack

Standard restraining bolts are produced by the billions by companies like Industrial Automation. 

[P]Most droids cannot resist restraining bolts when one is attached to them (a process that requires a few seconds and a spot-welder). However, any Player Character who happens to be a droid is obviously made of sterner stuff than NPC droids. Player Character droids may make a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to overcome the effects of a restraining bolt and act normally when the bolt is applied.

These small, squat devices provide both light and heat for the surrounding area. They are also quite durable and reliable, and are commonly found in larger travel kits and survival packs. Characters can also plug other electronic devices into a fusion lantern to power them, such as datapads, glow rods, and small scanning devices.

A jet pack is ideal for fast maneuverability and surprise attacks. Most use small thrusters to blast into the air for short periods, though some augment this with antigrav devices. Their only drawbacks are their large size and weight, limited fuel, and the not inconsiderable skill needed to pilot them safely. 

[P]The Z-6 uses an air-breathing jet turbine to propel the user, maintaining stability via directional exhaust nozzles and a gyro-stabilizer. The pilot uses a verbal control interface and wrist controls to fly the jet pack. 

[P]A jet pack allows a person to function as a Silhouette 1, Speed 2, Handling 0, System Strain Threshold 3 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate.

Technology runs on power, and while most devices have internal power sources, these either run out or need augmentation. Energy cells are small battery disks that can keep most hand-held devices going for a while longer, while power packs are larger versions suitable for blasters and other high-demand gear. Extra reloads allow characters to ignore an out of ammo" [DE] result with a ranged weapon. By spending a maneuver, they may reload their weapons and get back in the fight.

      [H3]Tool Kit[h3]

In a technological galaxy, a tool kit is almost essential. Every vessel, no matter the size or function, has some sort of repair kit to deal with mechanical or electric failures, as calling for assistance is often not practical (or safe). Kits are also useful for repairing damaged droids or cybernetic parts, especially ones too modified to take to reputable mechanics. Tool kits need to have a wide range of gear, as many users are fond of tinkering and upgrading on their own. Basic hammers, hydrospanner wrenches, restraining bolts, power coupling scrubbers, fusion cutters, laser and sonic welders, replacement wiring and components, power calibrators, and of course welding goggles and heavy gloves are all standard components. Many of these also make for effective improvised weapons. For those used to doing extensive repairs, some kits include diagnostic probes and other aids to determine the nature of the fault. There is little a skilled mechanic cannot fix with a well-maintained and well-stocked toolkit, given adequate time to conduct the repairs (which is sometimes a problem too). 

[P]Toolkits allow mechanics to perform most Mechanics checks to repair mechanical devices, and can also be used to "heal" droids.

      [H3]Emergency Repair Patch[h3]

Emergency repair patches, like the SoroSuub Pocket Tech, are designed to be both portable and able to be used quickly in an emergency. An emergency repair patch consists of a semi-flexible durasteel disk rimmed with auto-activating thermal welds. Some also contain an electrically inert inner insulation layer to protect against shortouts. The patch can be quickly applied over a damaged portion of a droid's chassis, then almost instantly spot-welded into place, keeping the vulnerable interior safe from further damage and maintaining the chassis's structural integrity. 

[P]Emergency repair patches are one-use items that mechanics can use to patch small holes in items or vehicles, or droids can use to heal wounds. The second use is more common. It takes a maneuver for a character to use an emergency repair patch on himself or another. An emergency repair patch automatically heals 3 wounds on a droid. A droid can use emergency repair patches five times in a day. The sixth emergency repair patch heals no wounds—the droid is so patched together that further patches would be useless. It takes a day for the droid's self repair diagnostics (or some actual repairs) to restore his body to enough functionality to be able to accept additional emergency patches. See page 220 for more information.

Avabush spice is a drug that induces relaxation and lethargy, and some use it as an illicit sleep aid. Unlike many varieties of spice, it has no hallucinogenic qualities and does not cause physical addiction in most species. However, it does have one interesting quirk that separates it from countless similar drugs: avabush spice makes users more truthful, and can be used to extract information when combined with targeted and insistent questioning. Though not particularly valuable, avabush can only be found on the planet of Baros and in certain specialized greenhouses that maintain samples. It is considerably less effective than the various truth serums commonly employed by the Empire, but is also harder to detect and less unpleasant for those consuming it. 

[P]A character who has consumed avabush spice feels lethargic, and can only upgrade a single [AB] to a [PR] on any given check because of this mental torpor. Further, whenever this character intentionally tries to lie or conceal the truth, the GM upgrades any one [DI] in the dice pool into a [CH] Avabush spice's effects last for one scene or combat encounter.

Though nobody seems to know the drug's exact history, apparently some intrepid soul came to the realization that by consuming this chemical concoction meant for painting starships, humans and many other species can temporarily benefit from drastically boosted reaction times. Of course, this power is not without a price—booster blue has a number of deleterious side-effects, and overdoses are common, especially amongst pilots who attempt to overlap applications of the drug during extended combat operations. 

[P]A character under the effects of booster blue may upgrade the ability of any Agility, Intellect, or Cunning related check he undertakes once, reflecting his improved concentration and mental acuity.

Glitterstim is a vanishingly rare variety of spice, refined from the webs spun by the energy spiders of Kessel and mined by the unfortunate slaves sent into those pitch-black depths. Because of its photoactive qualities, it cannot be exposed to light at any stage before consumption, and so laborers at various stages carefully move it from the darkness of the caverns to special holding containers, and then to the small, opaque packets in which it is sold. Its production is jealously guarded by the Empire, and thus a hold full of glitterstim is a treasure for any smuggler ambitious enough to try to sell it. 

[P]The value of glitterstim comes as much from the uniqueness of its properties as its rarity. While it certainly provides a powerful high and is as addictive as many of its equivalents, rumors whisper that it has another, much more interesting effect when consumed. Glitterstim is said to provide those who ingest it with limited telepathic abilities. Of course, there are those who claim that this so-called telepathy is merely a drug-induced delusion, but many swear by the intuitive abilities that each dose imparts. Unfortunately, along with these supposed powers comes another certain effect—glitterstim slowly but surely erodes the mind, burning away certain nerves in the brain connected to sight and coordination, as well as mental balance. 
[P]Glitterstim is a highly addictive drug with hallucinogenic properties. Using it adds three [BO] to all Perception and Vigilance checks for the remainder of a scene. Additionally, some users report gaining temporary telepathic abilities, which the GM may choose to grant to any user at his discretion.

      [H3]Lesai[h3]

Lesai is a variety of spice that is not mined, but grown in a fungus found only on certain kinds of lizards from the planets Zebitrope IV and VIII. By harvesting the distinctive purple mold and applying it underneath the jaw, members of many sentient species can eliminate their need to sleep. The stains that the fungus leaves are hard to disguise, but it has few other confirmed side-effects. Most species become psychologically if not physically dependent on the drug very quickly, however, and users who miss a dose frequently collapse and only awake days later. 

[P]A character who partakes in lesai at least once every twenty-four hours does not need to sleep, and suffers no penalties or strain for lack of sleep. The character may remove strain as if he had slept a full night after any period of eight or more hours in which he did not engage in any stressful activities (such as combat, intense mental effort, or emotionally charged discussion). Lesai's only noticeable side-effect is that it leaves odd purple stains where applied. If a character under the effects of lesai ever goes twenty-four full hours without a dose of the drug, he finds it increasingly difficult to stay awake until he receives more lesai or sleeps. Some Imperial officials claim that lesai turns users into amoral monsters without feelings or compassion. Whether this is true or not is entirely up to the GM, and he should feel free to keep his decision secret from any players whose characters use lesai.

      [H3]Death Sticks[h3]

Death sticks are an unpleasant creation derived from the balo mushroom of the planet of Balosar and distributed in a liquid form in distinctive small red and yellow rods. Though the drug is only mildly hallucinogenic, death sticks are well-named; the active ingredient, Ixetal Cilona, is highly addictive and deleterious to one's health. Each dose tears away an ever-greater portion of one's life while simultaneously tightening the grip of addiction. Death sticks are illegal for obvious reasons, and more than a few smugglers who happily deal in spice or illicit arms avoid running shipments of this particular drug on what they term "moral grounds." Use of death sticks also weakens a person's connection to the Force temporarily, though few users or even dealers are aware of this fact. 

[P]Death sticks have a nasty result in the long run, but unless one's campaign runs over the course of decades or a character has had a death stick addiction for some years already, characters are unlikely to experience the truly miserable death these drugs bring about. A life-long addiction to death sticks typically halves the lifespan of most species, though various species are more or less susceptible to the effects of Ixetal Cilona. The short-term effects of a single dose last for one scene or combat encounter and adds [SE] to any task the character attempts, and may reduce the character's connection to the Force in certain ways at the GM's discretion. 

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Death sticks are controlled substances on most worlds, and at the very least those. under the age of majority cannot purchase them. Death sticks are completely illegal on many other worlds, especially those with high health standards.</Description>

Data breakers are basic tools of the trade for many slicers. While droid slicers are programmed to crack complex sequences, organics usually lack this innate option, and therefore rely on a data breaker to do the grunt work of opening systems to them so that their true skills can shine once they are inside. Most data breakers are also recording devices, and can pull vast amounts of information from ill-guarded systems in seconds. Droid slicers can choose to have a data breaker (or equivalent systems) installed internally at the same cost. Data breakers add [BO][BO] to any Computers check made to slice computers (as opposed to the usual one for having the right tools for the job). 

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] The Empire and many planetary governments restrict possession of data-breaking technology. Military and law-enforcement organizations make legal use of these devices, but typically civilian use of such technology is prohibited.</Description>

      [H3]Flesh Camouflage Set[h3]

A flesh camouflage set is essentially a comprehensive disguise kit, allowing the user to temporarily but dramatically change his appearance and even foil bio-scanners, obscuring his genetic sequence or mimicking one from another person kind enough to "donate" a sample. The disguise is good enough that any checks made to ascertain the user's true identity have their difficulty set at [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI])[b].

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Many elements within the kit are perfectly legal on their own, but most planetary and Imperial authorities take a dim view of anyone actually carrying a set of items that allows the user to mask himself down to a genetic level.</Description>

      [H3]Personal Stealth Field[h3]

Personal stealth fields, as the name suggests, are miniaturized stealth fields that allow their user to vanish from the sight of organic creatures and droids without sufficiently acute optics. Most of them are relics of an age long-past, though several contemporary efforts have been made by various military organizations to recreate this technology. 

[P]While they are undeniably effective for those who wish to pass unnoticed, the major flaw of most personalized stealth fields is that they are prone to collapsing. Scientists have theorized that this may be an unavoidable result of miniaturizing technology meant for starships, a design flaw, or a result of many of the active devices being antiques. In any case, few are lucky enough to possess one of these devices, and their infamous unreliability makes many prospective users wary. When using this device, it is impossible to see the user visually. In addition, any checks to ascertain the user's location by other means (such as hearing, smell, or observing the surrounding environment) have their difficulty set at [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI])[b]. 

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Personalized stealth fields are vanishingly rare, and so few governments bother to place restrictions on their use. Some am legitimate artifacts of ages past, while others are stolen military technology, and the particulars of their creation dictate their legality. Of course, law enforcement officers tend not to see these fine distinctions when apprehending people using them to commit crimes.</Description>

      [H3]Long Range Terrain Scanner[h3]

A variation on CryonCorp's successful EnhanceScan personal-scanner line of products, the Long-Range Terrain Scanner was developed with the professional explorer in mind. The LRTS uses a limited-power ground-following radar of the kind typically found on military airspeeders for low-level instrument flying. Typically mounted to slow-flying airspeeders or small landspeeders with a reasonably high maximum altitude, the LRTS allows a scouting team to make a comprehensive topographical map of a new planet quickly and efficiently. The radar transceiver is mated to a broadband sensor suite and mapping program that takes in billions of bits of data per second. In game terms, the LRTS has a range of long and can map quite a large area of ground in a single pass. Depending on the atmospheric conditions, the size of the area being mapped, and numerous other variables, the time required to thoroughly map an area can take from a few hours to a few days of concentrated effort. 
[P]Successfully using the LRTS requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b] on the part of the operator. Maps produced with the LRTS add [BO] to any Survival check made to navigate using the map plus an automatic [SU] for every two [AD] gained on the Computers check. </Description>

Another sensor suite produced by CryonCorp, the GPSP is a powerful ground-penetrating radar suite marketed to companies involved in gas and minerals exploration and chartered search and rescue. Little more than a bulky stack of fine-tuned sensors mounted in an impact and weather-resistant plasteel case, the GPSP uses a powerful ground-penetrating radar array to look through solid objects to see what lies beneath. Either carried slung over an operator's shoulder by a stout strap or mounted to a small repulsor cart, the GPSP can see through soil, dense stone of various types, most kinds of ores and processed metals, organic and inorganic debris, duracrete, ferrocrete, and nearly any other kind of substance that might be encountered. Recently, CryonCorp has released an updated version of the GPSP geared more toward scholarly exploration, with a radar array specially tuned for penetration of 
inorganic, artificially produced building materials like the kind found in the ruins of ancient cities. Using a GPSP does not require a skill check, but interpreting the unit's findings might. If the Game Master sees fit, he can require a Computers skill check to figure out what exactly the GPSP is seeing.</Description>

A more powerful variant of Idellian Arrays's ILF-5000, the ILF-6500 is one of the most powerful long-range, omnidirectional life-form scanners on the market. With a database containing information on thousands of known species of wildlife and with space for recording new data, the ILF-6500 is most often used as the center of a security perimeter for scout or hunting encampments. Mounted on a telescoping tripod that can extend up to three meters and capable of monitoring an area nearly half a kilometer across depending on terrain and vegetation, this scanner can track and identify up to two dozen targets at a time, categorize and rank them in order of threat level, and alert its operators either by sending updates to their datapads or sounding a shrill alarm. 

[P]Setting up the ILF-6500 requires either an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Survival check[b] or a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Education[b] or [B]Computers[b] check to ensure that the device is properly calibrated and located in the best possible area for taking full advantage of its scanning capabilities. </Description>

Produced by a number of well-known manufacturers of sensors and scanners, hunting goggles are a kind of scanner goggle specifically designed to assist professional guides and hunters in tracking their quarry. Along with the usual light-amplification and thermal-imaging sensors found in most scanner goggles, hunting goggles are equipped with an image magnification and enhancement system, a short-range motion detector, and a targeting system and micro heads-up display that projects aiming reticules and targeting information into the wearer's field of vision. Hunting goggles sharpen the wearer's vision to a preternatural degree, and they allow him to see clearly in the dark and through fog, smoke, haze, and other obscuring agents. All of these systems combine to make a highly useful piece of equipment for those who make their livings stalking beasts and sentients through the Outer Rim.

[P]Hunting Goggles grant [BO] to any Perception skill checks made to locate prey, and thanks to their image magnification and enhancement, they remove up to [SE][SE] imposed due to concealment, darkness, or fog and mist from all Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) checks.</Description>

Essentially a scaled-up medpac, the ECM-598 contains a clinic's worth of medical equipment, drugs, tools, scanners, and other contents needed to keep a team of explorers alive in the field. All of this equipment is securely packed into a sturdy internal-frame backpack. It also includes a slim datapad containing an emergency-procedure database for most of the known sentient species in the galaxy, as well as tutorials to assist those with no medical training in treating wounded individuals in an emergency. The ECM-598 even includes a collapsible repulsor stretcher with a weight limit of 150 kilograms for evacuating seriously wounded personnel. 

[P]The ECM-598 medical backpack allows characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty, as detailed on page 219 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook. In addition, it grants [BO] to all Medicine checks made while using the ECM-598 and, thanks to the tutorials and information on the datapad, individuals using this decrease the difficulty of any Medicine checks they make to heal Critical Injuries by 1 to a minimum of Easy ([DI]).</Description>

There are countless devices in the galaxy designed to incapacitate a target or prey animal so that it can be captured alive. These include stun batons, gas grenades, and even low-powered blaster rifles used to short circuit a sentient's nervous system and render him unconscious. One of the smallest, simplest devices is the ubiquitous electro-snare. Little more than a power pack, an energy-discharge node, and a proximity sensor contained in a light metal frame, electro-snares are produced by many manufacturers in the galaxy. Simple and effective, electro-snares are difficult to detect, nearly foolproof, and one of the safest and most humane stun devices on the market. 

[P]To use an electro-snare, an individual must make a [B]Survival check[b] to set and conceal the snare with a difficulty set by the Game Master based on surrounding environmental factors. Once successfully hidden, any animal or sentient approaching the snare must make an [B]Opposed Perception check[b] against the Survival skill of the character who originally set the snare. If the snare remains undetected, it fires a powerful stun blast at the target once it enters engaged range, automatically hitting and dealing 10 stun damage (the damage is applied to the target's strain threshold but does not ignore soak), plus 2 additional damage per [SU] scored on the initial Survival check.</Description>

The advanced textiles that compose the structure have a natural heat-exchanging property that keeps the interior of the shelter at a constant comfortable temperature no matter what the external temperature is. The shelter is weatherproof, and a special foil-fiber mesh is woven into the fabric that makes it flameproof and able to withstand lightning strikes. portable survival shelters are also equipped with a water-reclamation system that is designed to double a user's carried water supplies. When stowed, these items are about the size of a large datapad and pack easily in a backpack, pannier, or shoulder bag. Unfolding the shelter makes it spring immediately to shape, and within the span of a minute it is ready for use.</Description>

Composed of a powerful energy generator and a number of sturdy plasteel posts equipped with repeater/booster modules and long anchoring spikes, these fences are constructed by simply finding a safe place for the generator and placing the posts along the desired perimeter. Once the perimeter is set, the generator is hooked up to one of the posts to provide the energy. When the generator is activated, the power it produces is projected and amplified by each of the fence posts, creating a nearly impassable fence made of crackling, humming energy beams. Basic models must be completely deactivated to allow anything to pass through, but the more advanced models have controls that allow for the various sections between posts to be activated and deactivated at will. Anyone coming into contact with a portable electric perimeter fence suffers the effects of a stun grenade.</Description>

      [H3]Viscera Field Dressing Kit[h3]

When hunting for sustenance or for pure sport, most hunters kill their prey in the field as opposed to trapping it and taking a live—and possibly quite angry—animal back to camp. Quite often these creatures weigh hundreds of kilograms, and even the most well-equipped hunting party balks at dragging a large, dead prey animal overland for many kilometers. To this end, most prey is butchered in the field, its innards removed and the usable meat cut from the carcass and stored in cooling chests for easy transportation. Referred to as field dressing, the act of cleaning and gutting an animal is a bloody and time-consuming task that, like most other complex tasks, can be made quicker and easier through the use of proper tools. For the discerning hunter, SurvivalEquipment Inc. sells the popular and easily carried Viscera Field Dressing Kit. 

[P]The Viscera Field Dressing Kit contains a selection of saws and knives of various shapes and sizes, gut hooks, spring-loaded shears, a portable vacuum packer, sturdy gloves, and a ten-meter coil of extremely strong and incredibly thin synthetic rope. The blades of the tools are all made of a resilient, precision-laser-ground, durasteel-reinforced crystal-ceramic that keeps its edge far longer than other types of knives. These tools come in a compact, locking, impact-resistant polymer case with custom-cut form-fitted recesses for each knife, hook, and saw. The case also contains a small, low-storage datapad with anatomical charts for most known sport and food animals, as well as charts showing different cuts of meat, butchery instructions, sanitation instructions, and other helpful tips for dressing a kill.

Little more than a small audio-playback machine encased in a sturdy, impact-resistant shell, a beast call is used to lure creatures out of hiding by speaking to them in their own language. They contain a sophisticated audio-signal modulator similar to those used by droid manufacturers to give their creations voice, as well as a nearly bottomless programmable database capable of holding the various screeches, howls, and calls of numerous known animal species throughout the galaxy. Along with the preprogrammed database, these devices can also record sounds, allowing a user to build his own sound library generated by previously unknown creatures. 

[P]To use, a hunter simply sets the type of beast he wants to attract, places the beast call in a convenient area; and activates it. The call then plays back the appropriate sounds at varying pitches and volumes until a creature or creatures are attracted or the user turns the device off. The sounds produced by the beast call are so realistic that members of the species being imitated are hard pressed not to come as quickly as they can to investigate. 

[P]Using a beast call to lure an animal requires no skill check, but the beast being targeted must make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to resist the call. To record a particular beast's call to use later, the user must make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b] modified by any other environmental conditions (heavy background noise, atmospheric interference, etc). </Description>

      [H3]"Quickflash" Burning Gel[h3]

Burning gel is an electrochemical hull-breaching agent synthesized and sold by the Corellian Chemical Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals. Colloquially referred to as the "shipwright's spare key," burning gel is used to gain access to doors, hatchways, and machine compartments that have been rendered inaccessible. When applied, it quickly burns through nearly any substance, in any environment, including the vacuum of space. It is commonly used to cut holes in starships that are derelict or otherwise damaged and adrift in space and is quite popular among salvage outfits, archaeologists, and other less savory characters. Unlike cutting torches and welders, it emits no flame and requires no oxygen to operate, making it preferable for use in a vacuum. 

[P]The gel itself consists of two parts: a stable, extremely caustic acid suspended in a clear gel that adheres to nearly any substance and a pair of thin electrodes. Both parts are contained in a dispenser unit that includes a refillable tank of gel and electrode wire, a tiny power generator, and a pistol-grip applicator. When the applicator trigger is squeezed, a measure of gel is released from the applicator along with the wires contained within. Once the desired amount of burning gel has been applied, the power generator is activated, running a quick, high-powered charge through the gel and activating the acid, which immediately begins eating away at whatever it's been applied to. 

[P]For rules purposes, exposure to burning gel deals damage to materials and sentient beings as if it were a weapon. It deals 10 damage and has the Burn 5 and Pierce 5 weapon qualities. Using burning gel requires no skill check. However, placing it correctly and effectively might, at the Game Master's discretion, require a Mechanics check.</Description>

      [H3]Chem Lure[h3]

Similar to the beast call, the Beastmaster Chem Lure by CorChemCo is designed to attract beasts to a place where they can be easily captured or killed. However, where the beast call uses sound and recording technology, the Beastmaster does so through the use of pheromones. Small and easy to conceal (around the size of a typical datapad), the Beastmaster contains an exhaustive database listing the genetic codes of most known species in the galaxy. With the creature database and an onboard testing and recording suite that contains a DNA sequencer and a chemical synthesizer, the Beastmaster can create nearly any pheromone, musk, or other biological secretion. It can also be programmed with new DNA if it is provided with a physical sample such as blood, hair, skin, or bone. 

[P]To use, a hunter first chooses his creature from the database or creates a new entry with a sample. Then he simply conceals the chemical lure, retreats to an upwind location, and settles in to wait. The Beastmaster uses the DNA information stored in the database to synthesize the correct chemical, aerosolizes it, and then slowly releases it over the course of one standard hour. The synthetic pheromones are incredibly hard for a targeted beast to resist, and the Beastmaster typically has a better chance of luring in its prey than a beast call or other apparatus. 

[P]Creatures targeted by the Beastmaster must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to resist, otherwise they come as quickly as possible to investigate. These items are often used with electro-snares or other live-trapping equipment to capture exotic animals alive for use as pets, zoo animals, and research subjects. Using the Beastmaster does not require a skill check, although placing it in the best position might, at the Game Master's discretion, require a Survival check.</Description>

      [H3]Excavator's Precision Tool Kit[h3]

Galactic civilization is incredibly ancient. Sentient beings have been plying the spacelanes and settling planets for millennia. Cities, empires, and even entire civilizations have risen, flourished, and fallen numerous times in countless places in the galaxy. Occasionally, these ancient peoples left behind great works of engineering—ancient cities, vast orbiting shipyards, lonesome abandoned space stations, huge necropolises, and the like—but mostly they drove themselves into oblivion, and the only remains are shattered remnants and half-remembered stories. Throughout the galaxy, intrepid sentients of all species who possess a wandering spirit and a thirst for knowledge sift through the remains of the ancient past to both help understand where the species of the galaxy have been and where the future is taking them. To help these adventurous scholars with their labors, numerous precision-tool makers in the galaxy produce tool kits of varying size and quality that make an attempt to be both compact and all-inclusive. By far the most popular of these tool kits is the Excavator Precision Tool Kit from Loronar Corporation.

[P]Designed for and marketed to scholars, historians, and archaeologists, the PTK contains a number of well-crafted hand tools and essential accessories for excavation of ancient sites and general exploration. Included are a number of hand spades and brushes of various size, a multitool, a stout knife, a pair of spring-loaded shears for cutting roots and vines, metal and ferroceramic files for sharpening tools, writing utensils, sample bags of various sizes, adhesive and string tags for categorizing finds, measuring equipment, a small spool of monofilament, and small picks, hammers, and mallets of different weights and material. All of this, along with a small, slimline datapad with high-definition recording capabilities, is all housed in a sturdy, lockable, weatherproof carrying case.</Description>

Surveyor's bags are made by numerous companies and are marketed to the men and women tasked with exploring and mapping the wild places of the galaxy. The bag itself has a vertical rectangular body with one large compartment, and it is typically worn over the shoulder and across the body, with the bag resting on the wearer's hip or at the small of his back. They are constructed of thick, hard-wearing, weatherproof synthetic textiles designed to stand up to heavy usage and protect the bag's contents from impact, the elements, and foreign-matter damage. The large compartment can hold all manner of equipment and has a sleeve sewn inside that fits most common datapads and portable computers. The exterior of the bag holds a number of covered pouches of different shapes and sizes, with additional clips, straps, and loops for extra carrying and storage. A single large flap folds down and securely covers the main compartment and most of the external pouches. The inside of the flap has a weather-proof, see-through pouch for storing maps, charts, and other references for quick access and easy reading. 

[P]Surprisingly roomy for their compact size, surveyor's bags increase the user's encumbrance threshold by 2.</Description>

Most sentients who make their livings as common crew aboard large civilian vessels tend to be lifelong transients, wandering from ship to ship and world to world in search of employment. A spacer might serve on dozens of ships during his career and travel untold millions of light-years, his only home the crew berths of cargo ships and the hostels, bars, and entertainment districts of spaceports. Such beings tend to travel light, carrying their entire lives with them from job to job in large cylinder-shaped bags colloquially known as spacer's duffels. Roughly half the size of a grown human and featuring one large compartment, a sturdy zipper, and a single shoulder strap, spacer's duffels have become a symbol of the free-and-easy life of the common spacer. Made by many different textile and storage-technology companies, these bags are as essential a piece of kit to the survival of a spacer as his certificates and his spacesuit. Among ship captains and recruiting agents, one of the most common sights in the spacelanes is a grizzled spacer with a hopeful look on his face, approaching with his duffel slung over his shoulder to inquire about work. 

[P]Spacer's duffels increase the user's encumbrance threshold by 2 but also have the Cumbersome 3 quality.</Description>

Made by numerous scientific-technology companies throughout the galaxy, such as Loronar Corporation and SoroSuub, specimen containers are ubiquitous among explorers who need to transport delicate or dangerous flora and fauna. They come in all shapes and sizes, from the simple petri dish to massive, environmentally sealed and controlled containers designed to hold the largest and most lethal creatures. No matter their size, shape, or manufacture, specimen containers all possess a set of common features and systems. They are constructed from sturdy impact-resistant polymers and have secure environmentally sealed lids. 

[P]They are generally transparent, the interiors of specimen containers are modular and can be configured to fit a number of small specimens or one large one. They are also usually equipped with life-support and stasis systems that allow specimens to be safely transported. 

[P]Specimen containers come in four general sizes, as follows: tiny, small, medium, and large. Tiny specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 1 and are typically roughly the size of a human's hand. Small specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 3-5 and range up to the size of an R2 series astromech droid. Medium specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 5-10 and typically require two or more sentients to lift and carry them. Large specimen containers have an encumbrance capacity of 10-15 and are designed to carry the largest and heaviest specimens. These last containers are so large that they have their own repulsorlift generators to assist in their handling. They have a maximum altitude of roughly one meter and move as quickly as they can be pushed. </Description>

      [H3]Cybot Galactica K-9 Series Hunting Droid[h3]

On the wilder worlds in the Outer Rim, many sentients still stalk the wild beasts of their native lands as their ancestors have done for millennia. While much of this activity, especially on the more primitive worlds, is largely done to put food on the table, there are those hardy individuals for whom it is more a sport and less a necessity. Big-game hunting is big business in the Outer Rim, whether for exotic pets, firs, trophies, rare delicacies, or new chemical compounds and other components valuable to corporations. The men and women who spend their time stalking these creatures often travel with an animal or droid companion. 

[P]To aid hunters, Cybot Galactica sells the K-9 series hunting-and-tracking droid. Large, stoutly constructed droids roughly the size of a krayt-dragon hatchling, they have a distinctly canine appearance with their long bodies, wedge-shaped heads, and powerful tails. They are equipped with top-of-the-line sensors that allow them to hear frequencies well outside the ranges of most sentients as well as to see in the dark, perceive thermal emissions, and see over long distances. They are also one of the few droids equipped with advanced olfactory sensors, allowing the K-9 series to track by scent. They have crushing jaws full of sharp teeth, and their feet are equipped with retractable claws to help them take down their prey. 
[P]The K-9 series droids are also quite powerful, agile, and cunning, capable of leading other droids or hunting animals in packs. While they are intelligent, their programming and personalities are so focused that they tend to speak, when they speak at all, in clipped sentences punctuated with animal sounds and machine noises.</Description>

The new All-Terrain Exploration Droid by Cybot Galactica is designed to assist in the exploration and surveying of newly discovered planets. Hailed as one of the most adaptable and competent surveying droids released in recent years, the AT-ED is set to revolutionize the field of planetary exploration. The AT-ED is a nonhumanoid, Class 2 droid built to operate in the harshest, most inhospitable environments. The AT-ED appears at first glance to be a two-and-a-half meter tall version of Kuat's AT-PT Assault Walker. A long, lightly armored trapezoidal chassis perches atop a pair of reverse-articulated legs with broad, round feet and three grasping toes each. Thanks to their drivetrain layout and the precision with which they are engineered, these droids have exceptional balance and are quite adept at traversing rough and broken ground. 

[P]The chassis is crowded with sensors, photoreceptors, microphones, and antennae. Mounted to the left side of the chassis is a powerful, long-range light that can zoom or flood its beam and can project light in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet spectra, and the ride side mounts a blaster for defense. 

[P]A full array of audio and visual sensors feed information into the droid's computer while the numerous scientific instruments and topographic-surveying tools monitor and sample air, soil, water, radiation, and dozens of other variables while making detailed three-dimensional maps of the surrounding countryside. They can even coordinate with orbiting ships, sending and receiving telemetry to develop a thorough picture of a newly discovered world and what it has to offer. AT-EDs are expensive to purchase and maintain, and their numerous complex systems need significant attention to keep running. Despite these limitations and their strange, standoffish personalities, AT-EDs are very popular in the Outer Rim.</Description>

Pilot droids have been a common sight throughout the galaxy for millennia. They are produced in a variety of styles, from the diminutive repulsor-driven RX series to the lanky, skeletal cyclopes of the FEG series, and range from simple automated pilots following preprogrammed routes to highly talented droids capable of flying a snubfighter against Imperial Navy pilots. 

[P]The JC series produced by Industrial Automaton takes all of these qualities and turns them on their head. A bipedal, humanoid descendant of the well-respected V-series pilot droids, with which the JC series shares much of its internal systems architecture, these new-style pilot droids are unlike any previously seen on the market. They are brash, aggressive, head-strong droids programmed to be highly competitive in all matters to do with flying starships and atmospheric craft. Whereas a typical pilot droid speaks in a calming baritone and has a steady demeanor, JC-series droids speak in a quick, strong feminine voice full of confidence and swagger. 

[P]They were designed initially to act as test pilots and were marketed to shipbuilding and military-contracting concerns such as Incom and KDY. Quite intelligent for a nonacademic droid, the JC series is equipped with powerful and versatile piloting software, a datalink that allows them to connect directly to a ship's internal systems, and upgraded servos, circuits, and myomer-synthetic musculature to make them incredibly agile. While they are not built with direct combat in mind, they are equipped with a pop-up blaster pistol concealed in their right forearm along with the programming to use them, giving these droids some self-defense capabilities. Most of the JC series are still in service with their original buyers, flying small- and medium-sized prototype spacecraft to the limits of their construction and often paying for it with their lives. Those few that found their way into general civilian hands, especially in the Outer Rim, have found their share of work with traders, smugglers, explorers, and other individuals who tend to live exciting and dangerous lives and might need the services of a talented copilot.</Description>

Most planets in the galaxy are integrated into a local subspace network independent of the galaxy-spanning HoloNet, with hyperspace transceivers on deep-space relay satellites to create sector-wide communications grid. 

[P]Most starships have hypertransceivers to send long-range messages and transmit distress signals. Small, portable hypertransceivers are also available, with ranges up to about 25 light years. Utilizing local subspace systems, these transceivers can potentially send a message anywhere in the galaxy, routing the transmission across networks. Many smugglers and assorted criminals prefer to send messages using private hypertransceivers rather than the HoloNet in order to make their communications harder to detect and trace.</Description>

      [H3]Whistler Encryption Module[h3]

Designed to encode messages sent over comlink or via subspace, encryption modules attach to comlinks or hypertransceivers and allow for secure communications on the battlefield or across long distances. Significantly larger and far more sophisticated than a simple comm scrambler, encryption modules use extremely complex algorithms and ciphers to code transmissions. Without the decryption key needed to decode the transmission, it is nearly impossible to break the code. Used primarily by diplomats, military, and large corporations, encryption modules have also proved useful for bounty hunters, smugglers, and others on the fringe who wish to keep their communications private.

[P]Attempts to decode messages sent through an encryption module without a receiver with the decryption key are [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI])[b] and require the use of sophisticated equipment, such as a ship's mainframe or a Class One droid. Attempts to decode an encrypted message without a computer are impossible.</Description>

      [H3]Remote DVI Activator (Long Range)[h3]

Useful for those needing to make a speedy getaway, a remote activation controller (also known as a beckon call) is a small, handheld device that can be worn on the wrist or stowed in a pocket. Linked to a slave circuit, a beckon call allows the user to remotely activate the coupled vehicle or starship. Inexpensive, low-end models, such as the Bespin Motors Remote DVI Activator, have relatively short ranges of no more than two to five kilometers, while exceptionally sophisticated beckon calls can transmit through hyper-space up to a parsec and instruct the ship's autopilot to fly to the user's location. 

[P]Inexpensive models simply activate the vehicle or ship's engines from no more than 5 kilometers away and run simple pre-flight checks, allowing the pilot to take off right away. More advanced beckon calls can summon a vehicle or starship, though the autopilot is only capable of performing simple maneuvers, which can be complicated by weather conditions and other obstacles. Some models can be used to remotely pilot a vehicle or starship via slave circuit, though this requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Piloting check[b]. </Description>

Implanted in the palm and fingers of the user (or incorporated into prosthetic hands) and linked to the user's brainstem, the cybernetic avionics interface allows a pilot to connect with his airspeeder or starship's avionics and flight control systems at a digital level. While interface doesn't eliminate the need for manual control of a vessel, it does significantly improve a pilot's reaction time and help provide instantaneous feedback from the ship's computer. 

[P]A character with a cybernetic avionics interface and at least 1 rank in Piloting (Planetary) or Piloting (Space) gains + 1 to the appropriate Piloting skill when flying a starship or airspeeder. The avionics in speeders, swoops, and other repulsorcraft are generally too primitive to interface with, but a player may do so at the GM's discretion if the vehicle is equipped with a particularly advanced flight control computer.</Description>

A highly specialized maintenance droid, fire suppression droids perform the singular function of putting out fires. These droids are particularly useful aboard starships, where fires can quickly burn up the oxygen and cause irreparable damage to a vessel. Generally mounted on tracked chassis or repulsorlifts and fitted with large tanks of chemical fire retardants, fire suppression droids can quickly respond to out-of-control fires raging through a ship and are able to safely work under conditions that would be hazardous or even lethal to organic beings. 

[P]Fire suppression droids can be used aboard any vehicle or starship with a silhouette of 4 or larger. However, the larger the vessel, the more droids are needed to adequately protect the vessel from fires. A vessel with a silhouette of 4 may require only one fire suppression droid, while a bulk transport or corvette would need several; a starship the size of an Imperial Star Destroyer would need hundreds of droids to adequately protect its massive bulkheads and kilometers of corridors and access shafts. These droids are able to put out small fires independently.</Description>

      [H3]IRAPS Cerebral Stabilizer[h3]

These lifesaving but nightmarish devices, known as "brain cages," are designed to preserve the viability of the central nervous system in critically injured patients. The IRAPS is a full-face helmet with IV lines injected into the large vessels of the patient's neck. The blood circulating in the patient's brain is replaced with a hyper-oxygenated nutrient solution, and thermal circuits in the helmet apparatus reduce cranial temperature to provide critical metabolic stabilization. 

[P]A cerebral stabilizer must be applied to a patient within one round of suffering a Critical Injury. This device may be applied to a character suffering from a Bleeding Out or The End is Nigh Critical Injury, or a character who has died during the current round. Applying the device requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Medicine check[b]. Once applied, the character is stabilized. If he died, he is brought back to life and counts as suffering a Gruesome Injury critical Injury (and all of its effects). Otherwise, his critical injury effects are canceled, though he still suffers from the injury itself.</Description>

The integrated computer contains medical and surgical databases for most prominent species and can even suggest emergency treatment protocols and provide step-by-step instruction. It can be easily used by the untrained to stabilize a patient. 

[P]Medpacs allow characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty, as detailed on page 219 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook. In addition, if the user has no ranks in Medicine, he counts as having 1 rank in Medicine when using this medpac.</Description>

This sophisticated and versatile camouflage is used by military personnel to conceal encampments, supply caches, vehicles and other high-value assets. Fabritech CN-15 Camouflage Netting contains photoreactive fibers that enable it to match the visual profile of its surroundings, as well as jamming circuitry that offers an effective countermeasure against standard sensor sweeps. 

[P]CN-15 Camouflage Netting adds automatic [FA][FA] to all checks made to detect items concealed by it. One roll of netting can conceal one object up to silhouette 2, two rolls can conceal one object up to silhouette 3, and three rolls can conceal one object up to silhouette 4.

      [H3]Death Sticks[h3]

Death sticks are an unpleasant creation derived from the balo mushroom of the planet of Balosar and distributed in a liquid form in distinctive small red and yellow rods. Though the drug is only mildly hallucinogenic, death sticks are well-named; the active ingredient, Ixetal Cilona, is highly addictive and deleterious to one's health. Each dose tears away an ever-greater portion of one's life while simultaneously tightening the grip of addiction. Death sticks are illegal for obvious reasons, and more than a few smugglers who happily deal in spice or illicit arms avoid running shipments of this particular drug on what they term "moral grounds." Use of death sticks also weakens a person's connection to the Force temporarily, though few users or even dealers are aware of this fact. 

[P]Death sticks have a nasty result in the long run, but unless one's campaign runs over the course of decades or a character has had a death stick addiction for some years already, characters are unlikely to experience the truly miserable death these drugs bring about. A life-long addiction to death sticks typically halves the lifespan of most species, though various species are more or less susceptible to the effects of Ixetal Cilona. The short-term effects of a single dose last for one scene or combat encounter and adds [SE] to any task the character attempts, and may reduce the character's connection to the Force in certain ways at the GM's discretion. 

[P][B]Restrictions:[b] Death sticks are controlled substances on most worlds, and at the very least those. under the age of majority cannot purchase them. Death sticks are completely illegal on many other worlds, especially those with high health standards.</Description>

      [H3]Extra Reloads (Model 77 SmartTranq Rounds)[h3]

Developed in cooperation with CorChemCo,  SmartTranq is an adaptable synthetic tranquilizer designed to be used with the Model 77 Air Rifle. When the tranquilizer enters the bloodstream of a target, it immediately begins to mutate, changing constantly and reconfiguring itself to find the quickest, most efficient way to overwhelm the target's defensive systems and render it unconscious. 

[P]Upon a successful hit with the Model 77, the target must immediately make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Resilience check[b]. If the target fails, it suffers 5 strain, plus 2 additional strain per [TH] generated on the check. If the check generates [DE], the GM can spend it to make the target check against the tranquilizer again during the next round. If the GM does so, increase the difficulty of the check by one.

[P]Equipping the Model 77 with SmartTranq costs 500 credits. This does not change the weapon's profile—it simply adds the above special rule to the weapon. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, the user must purchase a reload (also costing 500 credits) before using the SmartTranq again.</Description>

The HoloNet is one of the crowning achievements of galactic civilization; a nearly instantaneous galaxy-wide communications network. By routing information through millions of hyperwave transceivers and routers, the Empire enjoys a peerless means of communication. 

[P]HoloNet relays, however, are ruinously expensive, and many planets on the Rim must do without. In addition, the Empire regulates the HoloNet and has reserved much of it for military use. However, for those who can afford it, a portable HoloNet relay is one of the few ways a colony can obtain instantaneous communication with the rest of the galaxy. 

[P]The X-500 Portable HoloNet Relay allows the user to communicate with the HoloNet (although at the GM's discretion, the signal may be interrupted by jamming, environmental factors, or Imperial interference).</Description>

Generally built of reinforced durasteel, magnacuffs consist of two full wrist restraints connected by a semi-rigid rod. Instead of crude mechanical locking systems, magnacuffs use tiny, powerful magnetic field generators to stay locked tight around an individual's wrists, and are locked by thumbprint readers or keypad locks. Magnacuffs can be adjusted to fit most known sentient species, and are popular among frontier law enforcement agencies, bounty hunters, and slavers.

Gandorthral Atmospherics is a leading provider of atmospheric engineering systems, producing everything from breath masks and hostile environment suits to massive, city-sized terraforming installations. The smallest of these latter items is the highly respected Elysium Model 2 Atmospheric Processor. Powered by a planet's natural subsurface heat and energy, the Model 2 resembles a massive ziggurat: a stepped, flat-topped pyramid full of systems designed to produce breathable atmospheres, clean water, and even weather patterns from the raw materials at hand. Roughly the size of a star cruiser, the Elysium Model 2 requires a crew of at least one hundred engineers and technicians, not to mention numerous droids to work in areas unfit for their organic colleagues. When deployed to a new colony, these processors commonly form the core of the initial settlement, and many a sprawling city throughout the Outer Rim has a decommissioned or repurposed Model 2 somewhere in its borders. </Description>

      [H3]GX-8 Water Vaporator[h3]

The most popular and well regarded moisture vaporator on the galactic market, Pretormin Environmental's GX-8 has provided fresh, safe water to planetary pioneers for generations. These delicate looking, spindly constructs consist of a five meter tall tower containing a low-powered ion generator and a powerful cooling system. The GX-8 rapidly cools the air around it, causing heavy condensation that is collected and purified by the systems at the vaporator's base. Once conditioned, the fresh water is typically collected in subterranean holding tanks for use in private, public, commercial, and industrial applications. Typically used on hot, arid worlds such as Tatooine, vaporators are organized in sprawling farms, or "water orchards," where their combined condensing and filtration systems can provide a steady supply of water for a settlement. A curious side effect of the use of moisture vaporators is the growth of lush native plants and fungi that tend to spring up in the constantly irrigated ground directly surrounding the machine. These small rings, referred to as "vaporator gardens," are good places to collect edible plants. 

[P]Depending on the moisture levels in the air, a vaporator can typically produce one to three liters of water in a standard day.</Description>

Nearly two meters tall, these broad shouldered humanoid droids are of average intelligence and possessed of a stern, imposing disposition. Programmed for both standard policing as well as fast response riot control duties, AC series droids are covered in imposing plate armor. Their heads have a single horizontal red band for a photoreceptor and they have only the merest hint of other facial features. Their personality matrix seems to have been programmed with the essence of every hard-nosed, uncompromising, "strike first and ask questions later" law officer in history. They are loud, brash, and skilled at physical intimidation. Their grating manner and their tendency to use overwhelming force in inappropriate situations has led to numerous complaints against both the droids and Rim Securities. While civilians may despise the AC series droids, law enforcement agencies throughout the Outer Rim love them for their brutal efficiency, and they are slowly cornering the market for police droids at the edge of the galaxy.</Description>

Around two meters across, the DZ-70 is a small, spherical droid equipped with a powerful repulsorlift system that provides excellent agility and overland speed. The droid's hull is studded with photoreceptors and assorted sensors that give it an unrestricted, 360 degree view of its surroundings. Two powerful, retractable claws are housed in covered bays along the droid's bottom, and it carries a blaster pistol and ion blaster as standard armament. While quite competent despite its low intelligence, a DZ-70's natural zeal and tenaciousness may occasionally lead to the development of an at all costs" mentality if the droid isn't given proper maintenance and regular memory wipes. This means that the droid does everything in its power, including the use of lethal force, to bring a fugitive to justice.</Description>

[P]Standing around two meters high, these hard working droids consist of a broad, round body like a high-walled serving platter around 2.5 meters across covered by a retractable clamshell cover. Dexterous manipulator arms ring the droid's body, and a dull red photoreceptor constantly scans its surroundings for trash. The droid's body is perched on a single hard rubber wheel and is kept balanced by a sophisticated gyro-stabilization system. More a remote than an actual sentient droid, these extremely dim-witted constructs are devoid of individual personality beyond a desire to hunt trash.

These machines are often designed to be robust and resilient, filtering out many different toxins and allowing those implanted with them to survive underwater or even in a completely airless environment for a short time. Certain models are known for making a regular, ominous rasp while others work in deadly silence. 

[P]A cybernetic respirator permanently provides a character with the benefits of a breath mask and respirator (see page 179 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook) and 1 rank of the Blooded talent.

      [H3]Gank Comm Implant[h3]

This peculiar comlink implant interfaces directly with the user's neocortex, allowing the user to communicate silently with other characters who possess similar implants merely by thinking. Virtually every adult Gank has one of these implants, which allows them to coordinate their actions with unparalleled efficiency. 

[P]Characters with Gank comm implants can communicate silently with each other at ranges of up to several kilometers. Since these implants do not use audible information exchange, they cannot be used to communicate with a normal comlink. Likewise, due to the unique nature of these devices, it is virtually impossible for anyone without the implant to listen in on others' comm implant communications, though comm jammers can disrupt their signals. The messages sent via Gank comm implants are not auditory, so effectively communicating requires the users to share a language.

Usually taking the form of a prosthetic finger or other artificial appendage, a cyberjack allows its user to directly interface with a computer system via a universal serial socket. The cyberjack connects the user's brain to a droid or computer directly. 

[P]Once per check, a character with an implanted cyberjack may suffer 2 strain to decrease the difficulty of a Computers check to disable a security device or slice into a computer system by one.

A vehicle control system designed to be integrated directly into the nervous system, this ingenious (if notoriously difficult to use) device allows the user to control a vehicle with a thought, moving it as if it was part of his own body. The cybernetic requires use of a linked control device, which must be installed in the craft in question. 

[P]When piloting a vehicle with the linked control device, a character with a neuromachine interface may use his Coordination skill in place of the Pilot (Planetary) or Pilot (Space) skill.

Also called a repulse-hand or an enforcer grip, this durasteel weapon cybernetic is typically neither covered in synthskin nor intended to appear natural. It contains miniature repulsor generators that can be switched on to deliver crushing blows and deflect incoming attacks. 
[P]A repulsor grip provides one rank of the Defensive Stance talent and counts as a Brawl weapon with a damage of 8, a Critical Rating of 3, and the Concus-sive 1 and Slow-Firing 2 qualities. This weapon has the Slow-Firing 2 rule, meaning it can only be used once every third round. This means that while a character may still make Brawl attacks when this weapon is "recharging" he does so without any benefits from the weapon—he simply makes an unarmed melee attack.

A popular game of chance throughout the galaxy, sabacc is difficult to master and even more difficult to cheat at. Each sabacc card has an electronic face, and cards in play can change randomly without warning, which makes card counting virtually impossible. However, clever hustlers and devious cardsharps have found various ways to mark their decks or tamper with the cards or randomizer to tip the odds in their favor. 

[P]Players using a marked sabacc deck gain [BO] to Deception checks when gambling. Noticing that a deck is marked requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI])[b] or [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b], depending on the quality of the deck (a higher quality marked sabacc deck costs 1,000 credits).

Countless credits have been won and lost on the roll of simple chance cubes. Basic and low-tech, these dice can be found virtually everywhere in the galaxy. The simplicity of chance cubes also makes them susceptible to swindlers who like to keep the odds in their favor. By weighting the cubes slightly, unscrupulous individuals can increase the chances of the cubes coming up either red or blue. While difficult to detect on first glance, even the thickest Gamorrean will eventually realize that loaded chance cubes, or "tops" as they are sometimes called, are anything but random if used too often. 
[P]Characters using loaded chance cubes may add up to [BO][BO] to Deception checks when gambling. Noticing that chance cubes are weighted requires a [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b] on the first roll of the dice, but the difficulty decreases by one for each subsequent roll.

More commonly known as slave collars, the security collars used by Thalassian slavers are actually technologically sophisticated pieces of equipment despite their simple function. Made of durasteel with an attached heavy chain and secured with a magnolock, these collars are designed to be escape-proof and tamper-resistant. Attempts to remove the collar without the proper circuit key results in a painful, potentially lethal neural shock to the wearer. Some variants come with biomet-ric or voice-activated locking systems. 

[P]Safely removing a Thalassian security collar without use of the proper key requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b]. If a character fails this check, the wearer suffers 2 strain and 1 wound (this ignores soak), and becomes Disoriented for 5 rounds.

In addition, the target suffers [SE] to any check he attempts while under the effects of the poison, and each [TH] he generates on those checks inflicts 1 additional strain (this ignores soak) as the target is wracked with pain and violent muscle spasms. The GM may spend [DE] on the initial Resilience check to make the target make another check against the poison at the end of his third turn or suffer an additional 5 strain (this ignores soak) as the poison torments him.</Description>

      [H3]Neutron Pixie (1 dose)[h3]

A powerful hallucinogenic spice, Neutron Pixie typically has a somewhat calming effect on the user. The spice is derived from Black Gabaki, a variant of the more common Grey Gabaki, and has a very high concentration of hallucinogenic compounds. The natural oils in the mushroom-like plant are quite pungent, leading most users to ingest the spice with a light fruit flavoring to make it more palatable. The Black Gabaki grows only on Toydaria, a secret closely guarded by the small ring of Toydarian spice-growers who manufacture Neutron Pixie, Even the Hutts don't know the origin of the spice, though many would undoubtedly pay handsomely for such information. 

[P]A dose of Neutron Pixie grants the user automatic [AD][AD] on Agility- and Willpower-related checks until the end of the encounter. Once its effects end, the character suffers automatic [TH] all Brawn, Intellect, and Cunning-related checks for the remainder of the game session due to nausea, muscle aches, weakness, and mental torpor.</Description>

      [H3]Ardos Disk[h3]

Small coins or medals made of aurodium mined from Varl, Ardos disks are valuable not merely for their rare metal content, but for what they represent. Bearing a stylized image of the star Ardos on one side and the sigil of the kajidic issuing the disk on the other, Ardos disks are given as rewards to highly favored servants and emissaries. They identify the bearer as being under the protection of the Hutts. For a Hutt to kill the possessor of an Ardos disk is nearly as taboo as the murder of another Hutt: most Hutts and their servants honor the relative immunity afforded those given such a rare boon. Conversely, the theft or forgery of an Ardos disk is seen as a heinous act among the Hutts. 

[P]Upon displaying an Ardos disk, a character adds [BO][BO] to any Charm or Negotiation skill checks made with Hutts or their henchmen or servants. In general, most Hutts will honor the implicit significance of the Ardos disk and refrain from overtly harming or hindering the bearer. If the disk bears the sigil of a rival clan, however, the GM can upgrade the difficulty of any Charm or Negotiation skill checks with the Hutt in question once instead, though the Hutt will still be loath to openly harm the bearer.

[P]For instance, Jabba Desilijic Tiure might not be very welcoming or polite to characters displaying an Ardos disk given to them by the Besadii Hutts, but he would at least grant them safe passage through Desilijic space, and would not feed them to his pet rancor (at least, not without severe provocation). Since Hutts are extremely suspicious and imperious by their very natures, they often demand to examine any Ardos disk presented to them, even if they already know it is valid.</Description>

While Imperial officials generally turn a blind eye to the various dealings of the Hutts and their associates, those who traffic in high-value illegal goods and services often find it beneficial to make sure that their income cannot be easily traced. For those who prefer their money uncontaminated by any crimes committed in obtaining it, credit cleaners are an ideal solution. Sophisticated datapads incorporating complex encryption codes and logarithms, credit cleaners are designed to route Imperial credits and other electronic currency quickly and efficiently through a convoluted path of transfers and exchanges. Once so laundered, the funds are incredibly difficult to trace, making it virtually impossible for even the most skilled forensic accountant droids to tie them back to their source.

Not as popular in the Core Worlds as other spices, ryll has a ready market in the Outer Rim and the Corporate Sector.

Individuals who view anonymity as paramount, even in personal meetings, employ shadowcloaks to ensure their identities remain unknown.

Along with obscuring the user's person, shadowcloaks baffle most sensors and scanners, distort the user's voice, and provide various other identity-masking effects.

      [H3]Skifter[h3]

Perhaps the most common means of cheating at sabacc, a skifter is a rigged card. Like genuine sabacc cards, skifters have an electronic display that can shift to show any suit or value. However, unlike normal cards, characters can program a skifter to display any suit or value he wants, often by simply tapping at the corner of the card. By surreptitiously slipping the card into his hand in place of one provided by the dealer, a cardsharp can gain a distinct advantage—so long as he isn't caught.

[P]When gambling (see page 108 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook), a character using a skifter gains [BO] to Skulduggery checks to cheat.

      [H3]Holocron of Astrogation and Gunnery[h3]

A holocron, or holographic chronicle, is an organomechanical data storage device capable of storing tremendous amounts of data in a small package. These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. 

[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. 

[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. 

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. 

[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. 

[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user. [B]Two skills, determined by the holocron, become career skills for the holocron's user as long as it remains in the user's possession.[b] What these skills are depends on the holocron in question (see [B]Table 2-7: Holocron Skills[b], on page 109, for some examples of skill pairs). Further, some holocrons grant additional bonuses. Some bonuses are ongoing, but others take effect only once. In the latter case, the user may continue to consult the gatekeeper and even to search through the holocron for information, but the bonuses granted are not granted a second time.</Description>

[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. 

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. 

[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. 

[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user. [B]Two skills, determined by the holocron, become career skills for the holocron's user as long as it remains in the user's possession.[b] What these skills are depends on the holocron in question (see [B]Table 2-7: Holocron Skills[b], on page 109, for some examples of skill pairs). Further, some holocrons grant additional bonuses. Some bonuses are ongoing, but others take effect only once. In the latter case, the user may continue to consult the gatekeeper and even to search through the holocron for information, but the bonuses granted are not granted a second time.</Description>

      [H3]Holocron of Cool and Coordination[h3]

A holocron, or holographic chronicle, is an organomechanical data storage device capable of storing tremendous amounts of data in a small package. These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. 

[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness.

      [H3]Holocron of Xenology and Survival[h3]

A holocron, or holographic chronicle, is an organomechanical data storage device capable of storing tremendous amounts of data in a small package. These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. 

[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. 

[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. 

[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. 

[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. 

[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user. [B]Two skills, determined by the holocron, become career skills for the holocron's user as long as it remains in the user's possession.[b] What these skills are depends on the holocron in question (see [B]Table 2-7: Holocron Skills[b], on page 109, for some examples of skill pairs). Further, some holocrons grant additional bonuses. Some bonuses are ongoing, but others take effect only once. In the latter case, the user may continue to consult the gatekeeper and even to search through the holocron for information, but the bonuses granted are not granted a second time.</Description>

It's not unknown for a physician's kit to include all manner of salves, tinctures, poultices, and special bandages made from local flora and fauna. 

[P]A physician's kit allows a user to perform relatively complex medical procedures in the field. Like emergency medpacs, physician's kits allow a character to use the Medicine skill without penalty, as per the rules on page 226, and in addition grant [BO] to all Medicine skill checks. Also, thanks to their stock of stimulants and other unguents, these kits add an automatic [AD] to successful Medicine checks made while using the kit.

Data breakers are common tools used by slicers to force their way into secure systems. Essentially a data battering ram, they are unsubtle tools used for expedience instead of finesse and stealth. Many are also data harvesting devices, recording everything encountered in a system while the slicer roots around for nuggets of information. Most organic Slicers carry one or two of these devices, but droid Slicer Player Characters can have them installed in their internal computer systems as well. Data breakers add [BO][BO] to any Computers check made to slice computers, but they also add [BO] to any attempts to locate use of a data breaker in a computer system due to the "noise" these devices make. Data breakers are highly illegal, and possession or use of one can land a Rebel operative in a maximum security Imperial prison for a very long stay.

The signet ring has remained popular throughout the ages, used by nobles and official government dignitaries alike. Most are masterfully crafted and incorporate designs unique to the wearer or family, and modern signet rings typically incorporate embedded electronics that offer additional identity validation. Some signets are not rings at all, but are instead other pieces of jewelry, such as pendants, bracelets, or even gemstones mounted in the pommels of weaponry—such items fill a similar role, even if they are a different sort of adornment.

A surreptitiously captured moment can be turned into evidence that wins wars, topples governments, or simply persuades a certain person to remain silent. Many corporations and investigative groups have produced a wide range of specialized recorders that can be effectively hidden. Although usually made to capture full-color hobos and audio, sometimes such devices capture flat-screen images or audio only, depending on the needs of the user. These miniature recording devices can be installed in an innocuous item, such as a light fixture or chronometer, and left to record until retrieved by the operator. Simple programming optimizes data storage, pausing recording when no activity is detected.

      [H3]Cultural Etiquette Manual[h3]

Diplomats rely on protocol droids to ensure not only fluent translation, but also to prevent embarrassing cultural incidents. However, when a protocol droid is not available, or a situation is too specific for a general-purpose droid, emissaries turn to cultural etiquette manuals, specialized datapads with nearly every potentially relevant cultural detail for a given group. A cultural etiquette manual can, for example, help a diplomat choose the perfect opening gift when greeting an unfamiliar society, or avoid accidentally insulting a visiting diplomat. Of course, actively consulting a datapad during an important function creates a level of awkwardness, but the manual does enable a diplomat to extensively prepare beforehand or during a handy lull in conversation. 

[P]A character with a cultural etiquette manual adds automatic [AD] to social checks made to interact with members of the culture to which the manual pertains.

A common and relatively cheap tool of embedded agents and informants, a data dead drop enables the covert exchange of a datachip or some other form of encoded message. One operative hides the information in a concealed compartment in a relatively commonplace item such as a glowlamp or datapad. Later, a second operative collects the item. Ideally, the covert agents do not draw attention, and any others casually using the device fail to notice the modification. 

[P]To find the something hidden within a data dead drop, a character must make a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b]. At the GM's discretion, an unaware character might use Vigilance instead.

      [H3]Diplomatic Authorization[h3]

Most local governments are reluctant to chastise or otherwise infringe upon another government's chosen delegates, and sometimes diplomats can use this to their advantage. Whether traveling on a diplomatic mission, conveying an important message, or simply bringing some sample products from their homeworld, diplomatic authorization grants wiggle room that can keep eyes off a diplomat's true purpose. 

[P]A character with diplomatic authorization adds automatic [AD][AD] to all social checks involving members of a foreign government, and can often get access to individuals and services within that government that would otherwise be unavailable. Unless lawfully granted by an authorized body, however, this item can only be acquired illegally.</Description>

The Brennkeyes Syndicate remains among one of the most wanted criminal production industries, and survives only due to constant relocation and intense security regarding its manufacturing methods. The craftsmanship and ingenuity of its wares remains matched only by their corresponding illegality, leading to further inflated prices. The "Knack" restraining bolt has become one of their most popular standard items. It appears just like a standard restraining bolt. However, the 'Knack' can also be preprogrammed with an order that will be relayed to the droid at certain times or based on specified triggers. 

[P]This secret order might simply let the druid ignore the bolt under particular circumstances, or it might enable something more sinister, such as causing the droid to plot a course to a pirate base when its owner directs it to navigate to Coruscant. The programming can be detected only by accessing the restraining bolt through a datapad, and is not visible to anyone examining the druid's programming rather than that of the restraining bolt. 

[P]A PC droid can try to resist a "Knack" restraining bolt in the same way as a normal restraining bolt (see page 195 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).</Description>

As an action, he may reel in the cord, pulling himself to the target object (or, if the object is unsecured and lighter than he is, pulling the object to himself).

By means of a painstakingly constructed hinge, the wearer can access the tiny space within. Any substance could be concealed in the space, but most commonly, it is used to carry a dose of deadly poison. With carefully practiced motions, the wearer can deposit the fatal cargo into a cup, plate, or bowl with little chance of being noticed. 

[P]A poisoner's ring can hold a single dose of any poison (such as those on page 182 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook, or any other poison the GM deems appropriate). As an action, a character wearing the ring may make an opposed Skulduggery check against any onlookers' Vigilance to deposit the contents into a target's meal or beverage without being noticed.

The world of intelligence and counterintelligence fluctuates as recorders become more complex and more difficult to detect, and sweepers advance to keep up with them. Security sweepers are optimized to detect specialized electronic components, ignoring mundane devices such as holocams or datapads. Security sweepers precisely locate recorders and listening devices, but they typically cannot identify the exact nature of any such device. 

[P]A character using a security sweeper may check an area for espionage tools by making an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b]. If he succeeds, the device notifies him of the presence and location of any recording or espionage devices within medium range of his current location.

      [H3]3PX-Series Protocol Droid[h3]

Cybot Galactica, manufacturers of the renowned 3P0-series protocol droids, took a decidedly less human-centric approach to the design of the variant 3PX line marketed to customers in the Outer Rim. Because of the diversity of species throughout the vast region, the droid was designed with a face based on no particular species, but with elements of several prominent groups through a wide swath of the Outer Rim territories. The final result was recognizable to almost every species it encountered, but lacked the ability to connect with specific species as well as a more clearly defined 3P0 model. Sales of the 3PX line suffered as a result, leading to a limited production run. However, resold droids tend to command the price of brand-new droids, thanks to the droid's extensive cultural and linguistic databases. The Rebellion also favors use of 3PX-series droids, seeing them as a symbol that distances the Alliance from the Empire's pro-human sentiment.</Description>

      [H3]5YQ-Series Protocol Droid[h3]

The protocol droids of the 5YQ-series, while perfectly functional mediators, are widely regarded as cheap knockoffs of more popular models. They were produced by Cybot Galactica to compete with Serv-0-Droid Incorporated's near monopoly on sales in the Mid Rim, but the project was not given adequate resources to break into such a diverse market. The 5YQ design team ended up recycling most of the work done on the earlier 3P0-series, but replaced the deep cultural databases previously used with a wide but shallow array of details on every conceivable topic. The final result was a droid that could operate in any part of the galaxy, but with considerably less effectiveness than a more specialized model. Given time, the 5YQ line might have been able to develop a market, but the production lines were shut because of a lawsuit against Cybot Galactica for using Serv-O-Droid parts in the 5YQ-series. This was the final black mark for the line, leaving them with a market share far lower than their relatively unremarkable performance would merit.</Description>

      [H3]CZ-Series Communications/Business Droid[h3]

The CZ-series communications/business droid exemplifies extreme specialization in protocol droid manufacture. Its databanks feature a suite of languages and cultural customs smaller than comparable models, and it lacks information on species or cultures beyond the Core Worlds. Instead, the CZ-series is programmed with a near-complete database of banking and financial regulations, as well as storage space to record current market prices for any goods it might encounter. A long-range comlink enables the droid to observe markets across a whole planet or to access interstellar communications networks to track deals made throughout the galaxy. The model's one universally reviled downside is the standard paintjob, designed to draw attention to the droid in dealerships. It is a truly vulgar mix of bright green and orange—obviously, many owners have these droids repainted. 

[P]Although the Rebellion has limited need for the business acumen the CZ-series is built for, the droids are top-notch negotiators, often capable of reaching settlements solely on the strength of their programming. Furthermore, the droid's long-range comlink can serve as a distress beacon or homing device for Rebel cells in negotiations with groups of dubious trustworthiness.</Description>

      [H3]TC-Series Protocol Droid[h3]

The TC-series, produced by Cybot Galactica, is less widely known than the more affordable 3P0 models from the same manufacturer, but it remains one of the most highly regarded lines of protocol droids. Officially registered as a variant line on the more common 3P0 models, the TC-series is actually a solid upgrade in most aspects. The differences are not apparent to the casual observer, as the two droids are nearly identical visually. Instead, the improvements of the TC-series lie in two key areas of programming. First, TC units have benefited from increased design attention, giving them more stable and helpful personalities after some 3P0-series droids were reported to develop eccentric and grating personalities. Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, the TC-series is equipped with a more advanced version of the TranLang It communications module used throughout the protocol droid market. While almost any protocol droid is programmed with a vast array of languages and the capacity to decipher new ones with impressive speed, the TC-series excels above its competitors. The TranLang variant used in these droids uses adaptive programming to improve the unit's grasp on a language throughout a conversation, enabling them to attempt communication after only a few words spoken by a new species or culture.</Description>

      [H3]M-3PO-Series Military Protocol Droid[h3]

Technically classified as a protocol droid, the M-3P0- series was never intended to assist in negotiations or cultural exchanges. An M-3P0 military protocol droid manages logistical and analytical efforts for soldiers. Its chassis is better protected than a typical protocol droid, and it is programmed for military discipline in all situations. However, the M-3P0-series cannot withstand the rigors of actual combat. An M-3P0 unit is best deployed inside a secure installation where it can access tactical data or manage communications. The droid uses its encyclopedic knowledge of military protocols, tactics, and doctrines to assist nearby personnel. A commander with an M-3P0 advisor gains the edge of keen, dispassionate logic, while a quartermaster assisted by a similar aide always knows how to efficiently supply troops. M-3P0 units are sticklers for obeying whatever regulations apply to the group they are serving. and they are notoriously inflexible.</Description>

      [H3]LRD-Series Envoy Droid[h3]

Envoy droids fill an obscure but significant niche in the protocol droid market. Programmed for greater independence of thought than most and featuring expanded loyalty protocols, envoy droids are able to speak in their master's stead without supervision. While there are entirely legitimate uses of droid envoys, sending one is nevertheless considered a snub in most circles—usually taken to indicate that the droid's master considers his opposite number to be untrustworthy or unworthy of a direct meeting. Nevertheless, the Rebellion often risks the hard feelings, taking the opportunity to conduct negotiations without risking the lives of its agents by deploying LRD-series droids to suspect meetings whenever possible. 
[P]The LRD-series is one of the few envoy droids that receives a measure of respect when sent to a meeting. The droid's mimic circuits allow it to imitate its master with astounding precision. Having an LRD-series envoy at negotiations is considered nearly the same thing as having its master present; given the price of the model, it is generally not taken as harshly to see one arrive instead of a flesh-and-blood negotiator.</Description>

When Industrial Automaton entered the protocol droid market with the LOM-series, they gambled on an unusual strategy. Rather than compete directly with the dominant Cybot Galactica for the core of the market, they released droid designed for a more niche buyer. The LOM-series has oversized optical sensors reminiscent of compound eyes and other insectoid facial features designed to maximize appeal with similarly-featured alien species such as the Gand and Verpine. The LOM-series was a huge success, earning Industrial Automaton not only customers from that market but also among those who frequently do business with insectoid species. 

[P]As a gesture of goodwill, the Rebellion often employs LOM-series droids when working with insectoid species. However, the LOM-series is perfectly functional in any circumstance requiring a protocol droid, so they are often assigned to assist Alliance representatives, regardless of the species involved.</Description>

The XV-38 Portable Large Animal Veterinary Kit (PLAV) is produced by Xenovet, a Commenorian biotech firm famous for its high-end designer pets and precision veterinary equipment. Designed for use by veterinarians, beast breeders, or anyone who deals with large and often dangerous animals for a living, the PLAV features a veterinary clinic's worth of equipment in an easy to carry, man-portable package. Roughly the size of a large duffel, within its lockable, hard-sided case the PLAV contains enough drugs, medical supplies, specialty tools, and other gear to stabilize wounded creatures in the field until they can be moved to a fully outfitted clinic. The kit also contains a datapad containing a specialized knowledge and emergency procedure database for many of the more well-known beasts, as well as tutorials to assist those with no veterinary training in treating wounded creatures in an emergency. 

[P]The PLAV allow a user to examine, analyze, and perform medical procedures on all manner of creatures. Like the medpac does for humanoid species (see page 192 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook), the PLAV allow a character to medically treat alien creatures without penalty as per the rules on page 232.

      [H3]XV-09 Chemical Restraint Harness[h3]

The XV-09 Pacifier is one of the more uncommon products sold by Xenovet. Roundly derided by those who make their living with animals as a cheap shortcut used by quacks and animal haters, the Pacifier is designed to control a wild or otherwise uncontrollable animal through chems rather than training. Similar to a typical riding or restraining harness, the Pacifier is made of a sturdy and flexible synthetic weave that loops around a creature's ribs, chest, and shoulders with a heavy brace that sits at its withers. Built into the back brace is a refillable auto-hypo typically filled with a cocktail of behavior-controlling drugs. The auto-hypo is connected to a remote that can trigger the pump at up to close range, and is used in much the same way as a remote for a droid restraining bolt. While the drugs tend to make even the most cross-grained creature docile and biddable, they can also have a number of unforeseen side effects ranging from dulling a creature's intellect or senses to killing it with an overdose. 

[P]Using a Pacifier on a wild animal is a temporary fix at best, and should only be done in emergencies. Mounting the harness on a creature requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Survival check[b] to ensure the harness is fitted properly and the auto-hypo is situated correctly. The difficulty of this check can be reduced by 1 with a successful [B]Knowledge (Xenology) check[b]. If successful, the XV-09 grants [BO][BO] to any Survival checks made to control the beast wearing the harness. In addition, creatures that are successfully pacified gain [BO] to any Discipline checks. Game Masters can spend any [TH] generated by the initial Survival check to reflect one or more negative side effects caused by the drugs. The exact nature of these side effects is left to the Game Master's discretion. In addition, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to reflect a catastrophic reaction to the drugs, such as a heart attack or brain aneurysm, which results in the animal's death. While safe for use on animals, the powerful mixture of chemicals in the harness can be dangerous to the minds of sentient beings. Attaching the harness to a sentient being can result in permanent brain damage and even death. </Description>

Produced by the Verpine Chiles-Zraii consortium, the Foreman-series of owner's workshop manuals are a must-have for anyone responsible for the care and maintenance of a ship, walker, speeder, or groundcar. Written for an exhaustive array of ships and vehicles, from the Flare-S Swoop to the YT-1300 to the gravity control system of an Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, each owner's workshop manual features detailed, clearly written, and illustrated instructions designed to assist even an inexperienced mechanic in maintaining or repairing a vehicle, vessel, or a specific system described therein. The manuals are sold in single-use, read-only datapads that contain all the information needed to make repairs, and feature expandable, three-dimensional parts diagrams with constantly updated parts numbers and a wireless connection to the galactic holonet. They also include a diagnostic program that assists in maintenance and repair by using the vehicle's onboard computer to trace circuits and find faults within systems. This allows a mechanic to diagnose the problem with his machine, see what parts he needs, order those parts from the nearest supplier, and then gives him all the information needed to install the parts and fix his problem. 

[P]Using an owner's workshop manual allows the character to downgrade the difficulty of any checks made to maintain or repair the vehicle or starship for which the manual was written once. Owner's manuals give no bonuses to work on other vehicles for which they are not written. For example, an owner's workshop manual for the YT-1300 grants bonuses when working on a YT-1300, but not when working on a Y-wing. At the Game Master's discretion, a workshop manual can be used on two ships or vehicles from the same company with a high parts commonality, such as CEC YT-series freighters. The rarity of a workshop manual is equal to the rarity of the starship or vehicle for which it was written.</Description>

      [H3]R7-Series Astromech Droid[h3]

The R7-series is the latest member of Industrial Automaton's highly respected R-series family of astromech droids. Designed specifically for use in the newly released E-wing multi-role starfighter, the R7-series was developed in secret, along with its bespoke starfighter, as part of a joint venture between IA and FreiTek Incorporated. Using the development of IA's R6-series astromechs as cover, the R7 project set out to build the most competent and reliable astromech droid ever produced. Using an all-new, highly-advanced droid brain and the latest versions of IA's tried-and-true astromech programming, the R7-series outshines even the venerable R2-series as an astrogator, technician, and starship pilot. 

[P]The R7 is an extremely novel design, using few parts or systems from earlier R-series droids. While it still has the iconic R-series barrel-shaped body, domed head, and two outboard legs with broad, treaded feet, that's where the resemblance to its older cousins ends. The internal systems of the R7 are all new, and its power and computer systems are heavily shielded using circuit-hardening technology typically found in starfighters. The droid's chassis is reinforced and constructed from stronger and lighter alloys than previous models. The triangle-shaped sensor eye is packed with advanced optical sensors that allow the droid to see in nearly any light as well as scan and analyze materials and structures for microfractures and stress fatigue. R7s are programmed with an eager, can-do personality that stands in stark contrast to the strange and surly personalities exhibited by their R5 predecessors. 
[P]Unfortunately, despite all their advanced systems and genial personalities, the capabilities of the R7 series are limited. While they enjoy incredible synchronicity between their systems and the systems of the new E-wing starfighters for which they were designed, R7s find it difficult or even impossible to interface with older starfighters. Even the vaunted X-wing's systems are too slow and dusky for an R7 to use fully. R7s can be programmed to interface with other starfighters, but their compatibility can never be one hundred percent. In game terms, this means that when connected with any starfighter or other vessel that isn't an E-wing, an R7 loses the benefits of its Galaxy Mapper and Hold Together talents.</Description>

      [H3]Q7-Series Astromech Droid[h3]

The Q7 was the result of a joint venture between Industrial Automaton and Kuat Systems Engineering. Designed specifically for use in KSE's A3 Nimbus short-range interceptor, the Q7 is unique among IA's astromech droid catalog in both construction and personality. Using design specifications and access to the Nimbus' advanced new software architecture, IA developed its new droid specifically for use in the new fighter, a process that both companies felt would be a growing trend in the near future. After numerous failed prototypes, IA finally perfected the interface systems and the brand new Q7 was revealed along with the Nimbus to overwhelming praise from both the military and civilian sectors. 

[P]Unlike any of Industrial Automaton's astromech droids on the market at that time, the Q7 is as visually striking as it is competent. Combining the sensor dome of an R2-series with a lower hemisphere containing a miniaturized repulsorlift generator, the Q7 is a perfect alloy sphere roughly one meter across at its widest. The droid's body style was dictated by the size of the Nimbus, which is an incredibly tiny fighter, and the locations in which designers could find space. The ability to go anywhere, anytime, and to get itself into and out of its droid socket with no outside assistance was one of the Q7's biggest selling points, and one that played very well with those interested in military logistics and planning. The droid's programming and its ability to interface so seamlessly with the A3 was touted as the next step in astromech droid development. Many thought that having a droid built specifically for a given ship represented a significant step forward, as it meant that the droid and the craft could work in perfect tandem. The positive buzz around the Q7 lasted right up until the Republic Navy took delivery of the A3 fighters and their attendant droids, and then some ugly truths became quickly apparent. 

[P]As the Republic Navy became more familiar with the Q7 and its quirks, it became clear that the little droid was drastically limited in both scope and utility. The fact that it was built solely for the Nimbus meant that, while it was quite good at operating that fighter, thanks to its size, shape, and bespoke programming the A3 was the only fighter with which it worked well. The Q7 lacked the programming and the hardware to interface with any other ship or vehicle in the Republic Navy inventory, which, compared to the current R2 and R3 series droids, made it unsuitable for most work undertaken by Navy droids, such as the repair and maintenance of ships. In addition, the Q7's personalities, such as they were, were so single-minded and focused on their specific fighters that they were difficult to work with when doing anything other than flying the A3. Aside from their programming and personalities, the droids' repulsorlift system proved to be finicky, high maintenance, and hard to repair in the inevitable event of a break down. All of this added up to make the 07 perhaps the most loathed droid series in IA's history and a black mark on its otherwise sterling reputation. 

[P]After the initial run of Q7s were produced for the Navy's A3 fighters, production was ceased and all back stock Q7s were sold at fire sale prices to civilians and local governments throughout the galaxy. With the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Empire came the retirement of the A3 and the development of the new TIE-series fighters, which also meant retirement for the numerous Q7s in the inventory. Many were simply scrapped with their fighters and either recycled or returned to IA for parting out. Those that survived were typically reprogrammed as well as possible to work as general astromech droids and transplanted into surplus R2 and R3 bodies. Today, it's rare to find a functioning Q7, and even rarer to find one in its original body. Those that are still around are typically found in out-of-the-way places where their low cost and admittedly strong grasp of astromechanics make them an attractive investment.</Description>

The imposing dalgo is a riding beast native to Onderon and has a long history as both a beast of burden and a powerful mount. Though they resemble other equinoids, the herbivorous dalgos are larger and heavier, sporting short defensive tusks from their large mouths. While they make effective mounts, dalgos are often stubborn, and can spook if their riders are inexperienced or careless.</Description>

Originating from the Dune Sea on Tatooine, dewbacks are large four-legged reptiles who are well-suited to desert environments. Easily domesticated, dewbacks are used as both beasts of burden and reliable, hardy mounts, and like banthas, have been exported off-world for generations. Because of their resilience, these creatures are found in both Imperial and Alliance military forces. In the Stormtrooper Specialty Corps, sandtroopers make good use of their strengths in arid conditions; amongst the Alliance, dewbacks are deployed to SpecForce's 4th Regiment.</Description>

Eopies are ponderous but surprisingly strong and resilient animals used as both mounts and labor animals on their native Tatooine. Eopies are inelegant beasts with an awkward gait and strong natural odor. Despite their stubborn nature, eopies are excellent beasts of burden, capable of carrying far more than their lanky frame might suggest. They are well-adapted to desert conditions, capable of traveling for days without needing water.</Description>

"Horse" is the generic term in Basic for a wide array of single-hoofed quadruped species found throughout the galaxy. While more properly described as equinoids, they share a common physiology in size, speed, and the ease with which they can be trained as swift mounts. Many varieties of equinoids are found throughout the galaxy, as they have been traded as livestock for generations. Some are larger, more suited as draft horses and excellent at pulling large loads, while others are smaller and can be very stubborn. Such beasts are frequently used as pack animals, rather than riding mounts. The following profile is for a standard equinoid riding mount.</Description>

They are sometimes compared to the much smaller devvbacks, to which they bear some physiological similarities. Herbivorous creatures, fambaa are most often used as beasts of burden. They are also effective multi-passenger mounts, having seen combat action in the Grand Gungan Army in the decade before the Clone Wars. Despite their immense size, they are docile creatures, and are rarely phased or startled, even by the noise of battle. Gungans used them to carry immense shield generators, cannons, or armored howdahs that could transport numerous individuals into battle.</Description>

As with the fambaa, Gungans have expertly trained these amphibious beasts for use in a variety of ways in their society. Gungan warriors often take kaadu for reliable mounts, developing a close personal bond with their beasts. As with the fambaa, the kaadu saw action in the Battle of Naboo in 32 BBY. Unlike fambaa, however, Gungans are quite possessive of kaadu. Asa result, these creatures are not traded as often as other beasts they train.</Description>

Unlike many other bipedal mounts, kybucks have split hoofs rather than claws or pads, which may help them reach immense speeds for a bipedal animal. Unlike most other riding animals, kybucks are not very effective beasts of burden.

Perhaps one of the most unusual mounts in the galaxy, the Mustafarian lava flea is a giant arthropod that evolved for life on the volcanic environment of its homeworld. While considerably larger than the average equinoid, lava fleas have an uncharacteristically lightweight frame. This makes them ideal for leaping considerable distances, but less adapted for hauling heavy loads. The creature's exoskeleton evolved an internal structure of spindles not unlike an internal bone structure, made from the minerals the lava flea digests. This allows these extraordinary beasts to grow to sizes far beyond normal evolutionary constraints. Mustafarians often fashion discarded lava flea shells into heat-resistant armor.</Description>

Now an endangered species, the thranta were once a common sight in the skies of Alderaan prior to the planet's destruction. Unlike many other flying creatures, thrantas do not use their wings as a primary source of lift. Rather, their bodies naturally produce hydrogen, which is stored in several internal air sacs that keep them aloft. This may be one reason why thrantas evolved to be creatures purely of the air, no longer needing legs on which to land. Over time, Alderaanians domesticated numerous breeds of this beast to be used as mounts. Today, only the common and baleen thrantas survive in any measurable quantity. One of the few places one can find a thranta is above the clouds on the tibanna-producing gas giants of Bespin.</Description>

      [H3]False Voice Transmitter[h3]
[P]The Rebel Alliance has been known to utilize homemade devices known colloquially as false voice transmitters, or FVTs, to fool the Empire for years. The original FVTs were jury-rigged by taking the verbobrain from a protocol droid, a voice-synth box (possibly from the same droid), and a datapad, and combining them with a number of readily available components. The speaker either types in the words to be conveyed with the FVT, or uses a microphone to say them out loud. Due to the usefulness of such devices, the Rebel Alliance began manufacturing them in small numbers.
[P]As long as an appropriate voice sample is available, an FVT can replicate nearly any organic voice. When used to transmit messages via comlink, the replicated voice is nearly indistinguishable from the original. Despite the benefit an FVT provides, it is only as good as the voice sample used and the turns of phrase the user adopts during the vocal charade.
[P]When impersonating another individual with the aid of an FVT, the user can upgrade the ability of his Charm, Coercion, Deception, Leadership, and Negotiation checks once.</Description>

[P]Polis Massans, being unable to speak, have come to rely on artificial voiceboxes, similar in most respects to droid vocabulators, to communicate with other beings. While Polis Massans are capable of communicating telepathically, many individuals or other species find it unsettling unless they are accustomed to it. In cases in which a Polis Massan wishes to grant the utmost courtesy to a guest or associate, small electronic voiceboxes are used.
[P]Translation of a Polis Massans thoughts into speech through the voicebox is accomplished through a simple neural connection, which is established via a set of noninvasive electrodes. The voicebox can adopt any one of a number of preprogrammed voice patterns, though the default voice is largely mechanical and not unlike a droid’s. The device’s volume can be modulated with a thought. Polis Massans who use voice- boxes to communicate on a regular basis often attach them to their bodysuits for ready accessibility.

A PTP (or point-to-point) link is a multichannel personal communications device capable of transmitting audio signals up to twenty-five kilometers. Available in a wide variety of sizes and styles, PTP links were used extensively during the time of the Republic. As more powerful methods of telecommunications grew popular, PTP links became obsolete.
[P]Despite the obsolescence of PTP links, PTP transmission boosters and relays were installed on a number of Core Worlds, and they are still used exclusively on low-tech worlds the galaxy over. Because most modern communications devices are unable to pick up PTP transmissions, the Rebel Alliance often uses them in order to avoid Imperial eavesdropping. With the addition of PTP encryption devices, which can cost up to 1,000 credits, this archaic transmission format is almost undetectable.

[P]The mode of short-wave telecommunication used by the Verpine is undetectable outside their species. The Rebel Alliance has, through trial and error, devised a type of comlink that is specially tuned to the Verpine frequency. With such a comlink, Verpine communications can be intercepted, and direct communication with the Verpine can be established within a range of 100 kilometers.
[P]Interestingly, the signals received on a Verpine comlink when in close proximity to one of their colonies often consist of garbled-sounding transmissions that are, in fact, the product of every Verpine in the colony “speaking” at the same time. Such comlinks are much more effective when used in conjunction with a small group of Verpine away from a large colony.
[P]That said, Verpine also have some control over the frequencies in which they can broadcast, similar to the way humans can modulate the tones of their own voices. This allows Verpine to choose different “channels," which the comlink can then be tuned to, allowing for discreet communication even in the midst of the largest Verpine colonies.</Description>

Once the Q-4 discovers ore, it continues to search for additional veins, while larger mining droids are called in to extract the discovery.
[P]Referred to as “mole droids” by the miners who use them, Q-4s possess a cheerful demeanor and pursue their work with apparent glee. Despite their carefree and can-do attitudes, Q-4s aren’t particularly bright, and they often bite off more than they can chew if left unattended for long periods of time. They are used in small teams and deployed in large formations to search for ore, and they operated easily both in atmosphere and underwater.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Roche J9 Worker Drone[h3]
     [P]Despite its capabilities, the J9 worker drone was an abject commercial failure. Designed as a protocol droid, the series’ moniker, “worker drone,” was deceptive to potential customers, who assumed it was just another labor droid. In addition, the unit's appearance, which was distinctly bug-like, in conjunction with its flat personality, turned many mammalian species off. The Verpine even attempted to market the droid to other insectoid species, still without much success.
[P]Most of the J9 worker drones purchased by the public were placed in labor jobs, wasting their more advanced systems and programming on menial tasks. Because of this, J9s are some of the most intelligent labor droids on the market. Over time, however, they develop somewhat bitter personalities, as they feel they were destined for something greater but were somehow cheated out of it.
[P]The Rebel Alliance has acquired a large number of surplus J9 worker drones directly from Roche and has put them to good use. The Alliance realizes that the J9 is much more than a simple labor droid, and many of the units have been assigned to Rebel teams to assist them with translation and analysis. So far, the majority of these J9s have been a success in the field.

    [P]The G2 repair droid is a custom Sullustan design produced by SoroSuub. Intended to assist with shipboard repair, many of these droids instead found themselves utilized as pilots and tour guides for civilian charter vessels. Referred to as “goose droids” due to their widely spaced feet, long necks, and clumsy gait, G2s tend to possess a quirky demeanor and exhibit excessively chatty behavior. Over time, the droids also develop a unique sense of humor, trading witticisms and bad jokes with anyone who takes the time to listen.
[P]Overall, the G2 series droids were appreciated by their owners and the tourists they were charged with. Many G2 owners would relieve their droids of their jobs and keep them around as companions. The series’s downfall, however, lay in the fact that larger corporations considered them a waste of money due to their tendency to talk rather than work.</Description>

[P]The Siak’s personality is businesslike while remaining personable, and it can readily converse for hours about nearly any topic. Physically, the droid is a lot
more human than its predecessor, while retaining some obvious Verpine characteristics. As a result, the Siak-series protocol droid represents one of Roche’s most successful products.</Description>

The PCs can only learn simple applications of Warde’s Foresight until they attain the first kyber crystal, as outlined on pages 10-11.

[P]Most of the scout survey’s two-meter height is made up of eight spiderlike legs arranged around a relatively small spherical body. While the wanderer is quick and agile, the medical and scouting modules take up most of the available interior space, leaving little room for a personality matrix. As such, these droids lack any personality features, but they are well regarded for the depth, detail, and unprejudiced nature of the information they collect as a result.     </Description>

[P]Skilled artisans in the employ of the Jedi Order designed a utility belt for the use of Jedi Knights in the field centuries ago,  incorporating a number of useful tools and items of fine manufacture. Jedi utility belts are visually nondescript, and the pouches worn on them, as well as the compartments within them, contain a number of useful items and tools. These utility belts were not worn by every Jedi Knight in the field, but many found them to be useful, so various iterations and models stayed in circulation throughout the centuries.
[P]While Jedi utility belts found in circulation or on abandoned battlefields are typically empty, having long ago been picked over, Jedi caches have been known to contain Jedi utility belts that are still supplied. A Jedi utility belt contains a three-day supply of food capsules, an emergency medpac, a Jedi multitool, a slim glow rod, a comlink, and an aquata breather. A number of empty pouches are concealed along the belt's interior side, allowing the wearer to hide small items. In addition, a standard lightsaber can be securely hung from the belt for easy access.
[P]In addition to potentially containing the supplies listed above, the Jedi utility belt increases the wearer's encumbrance threshold by 1.</Description>

The helmet opaque shield prevents the wearers from relying on sight: instead, they must use their instincts. Of course, these devices are not particularly practical for combat, but they can be exceptionally useful to anyone trying to train in the ways of the Force. As artifacts of the Jedi Order, these devices are contraband, but they are hardly so obvious as a lightsaber, and so a number of them have passed into vicilian hands. Force sensitives in this era can acquire them with far less difficulty than most Jedi relics, or they can even make their own facsimiles using basic supplies.

Designed to resemble a four-legged canine, the GV/3 is broad and powerful in appearance. The droid's sturdy construction is further reinforced with plasteel plates, and integrated solar panels guarantee that it rarely needs recharging.
[P]The droid's programming emulates that of a very intelligent beast, and it communicates with its master in a series of yips, yelps, barks and growls. GV/3 guardian droids come standard with strong loyalty imprint software that can be keyed to any number of subjects. As long as a specific individual is imprinted in the droid's memory, it follows that being's commands and, to the best of its ability, prevents that person from being injured, whether by deliberate action or by accident. Despite the GV/3's physical strength, it is capable of being gentle and even playful, especially around children.
[P]The GV/3 is popularly used for home security and by law enforcement agencies. It has also been adapted to search and rescue operations with much success. Though it is considered a benign droid in most areas, some models have been modified by unscrupulous individuals for criminal applications.</Description>

[P]Also referred to as a "seeker droid" or "training remote", the MArksman-H by Industrial Automation is a versatile little droid that has found many niches, some of them unintended. This model of droid is employed variously as a basic security unit, a training tool, a pest controller, and even as a tiny assassin. Individuals the galaxy over continue to find new and innovative uses for this versatile droid.
[P]Some Jedi once preferred the Marksman-H as a training tool when teaching Padawans to reflect blaster bolts with their lightsabers. Even after the fall of the Jedi Order, some of these same droids remain active. A Marksman-H can be a tenacious opponent. It responds to a handheld signaleer which transmits high-pitched bursts of coded data, and can be programmed to receive verbal commands.
[P]The Marksman-H is a small, spherical droid only fifteen centimeters in diameter. Its tiny repulsorlift unit propels it in seemingly random directions without warning, making it hard to track. Studded with a number of emitter nozzles which are factory-equipped with micro stun blasters, these droids are commonly programmed for use as security drones.

      [H3]Personal Transponder[h3]
[P]Personal transponders are low-powered tracking devices used to locate individuals. While bare-bones transponders are available at relatively low prices, many individuals choose to personalize theirs for use as jewelry, such as rings, pendants, cuff links, or other affectations. Though the transmission range for personal transponders is hardly infinite, they can be easily located with standard hand scanners as long as the transponder's unique frequency is known.
[P]Picking up a personal transponder's signal accurately enough to find its exact location within close range on a planetary scale requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b]. Increase the difficulty of this check by two for each planetary scale range band beyond close, to a maximum of extreme range at the planetary scale.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Veridicator 200[h3]
[P]Designed and distributed by Saldalith Manufacturing, the Verdicator is billed as a personal lie-detection device. The user of the device can discreetly monitor changes in the physiological functions of a specified target nearby. It tracks metrics that include pulse, blood pressure, rate of respiration, eye activity and body temperature. Such changes are conveyed to the user by a series of discreet pressure nodes that pulsate against the wearer's skin.
[P]Veridicators are most often disguised as pieces of jewelry, such as bracelets or pendants, inset with a tasteful Falasian liquid crystal. The crystal is actually the Veridicatiors receptor, and it can only monitor targets within a sixty-degree scanning arc. Popular with security forces and corporate recruiters during interviews, the Veridicator has also been used by undercover operatives on both sides of the galactic rebellion. Though useful under the proper circumstances, the devices are only as effective as the individuals  who employ them. Only one target can be scanned and monitored at a time, and they must be relatively nearby. Both the user and the target must remain relatively still, though small movements are unlikely to affect the device's readings.
[P]A character wearing a Veridicator 200 adds [BO][BO] to checks to discern whether another character is lying or omitting significant information, and adds [BO][BO] to checks to ascertain another character's mental state.      </Description>

      [H3]InstaMist Generator[h3]
[P]Though designed for firefighting and agricultural use, Agrierd Intergalactics' InstaMist generator has found a place in the arsenals of some combatants who use it to create ambushes or make quick escapes. When loaded with a specially designed high-pressure mist cartridge and triggered, the InstaMist generator creates clouds of dense vapor. The vapor conceals the user (and anyone else nearby), providing an edge in both offensive and defensive situations. Other cartridges designed for use with the InstaMist generator create mists that can extinguish fires, generate humidity, or dispense pest control agents, but these tend to be separate, specialized products. 
[P]As an action, a character may activate an InstaMist generator to fill an area out to short range of the generator with a heavy fog. As described on page 219 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] core rulebook, heavy fog adds [SE][SE][SE] to Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), Gunnery and Perception checks against targets obscured by it, and adds [Bo][BO][BO] to Stealth checks made by characters concealed by it. The heavy fog lasts for three rounds. At the GM's discretion, windy conditions can cause it to become fog or mist or reduce the time it takes for the vapor to disperse entirely.
[P]The generator comes with five vapor cartridges. Additional vapor cartridges cost 10 credits each, and other cartridges vary in price based on their function.      </Description>

      [H3]Luma Flare[h3]
[P]Luma flares are rocket propelled illumination devices commonly used by both militaries and survivalists. Luma flares excel at illuminating dark areas, as their detonation spreads a luminous compound over a wide blast area. They are also popular as signaling devices, especially when used to attract the attention of search and rescue teams.
[P]Each luma flare is a self contained device with limited guidance capability. The flare's simple controls allow the user to guide its rough trajectory, as well as to adjust the blast's detonation point based on the desired altitude. A safety is included, which generally prevents the flare from igniting before the rocket reaches its destination.
[P]As an action, a character may make an [B]Easy (DI) Gunnery check[b] to launch a luma flare into the air to provide light. If he succeeds and the flare has room to travel into the air, he flare completely illuminates an area out to long range from the location it was fired. If he fails or does not have room to fire it, the flare still ignites, but does not travel into the air. Instead it remains at ground level, illuminating an area out to short range. Whether he succeeds or fails, the flare's illumination continues for five rounds, after which time it burns out.
[P]Though Luma flares are not designed as weapons, creative characters can nonetheless use them as such. They are extremely hard to aim, but the mere prospect of being struck with one will cause many foes to reconsider attacking. They have the following profile as a weapon: luma flare (Gunnery) Damage 6, Critical 3, Range Long, Blast 4, Burn 4, Disorient 2, Inaccurate 2, Prepare 2, Limited Ammo 1.

      [H3]AL-DR8 Grav-Binders[h3]
[P]Designed to restrain the particularly slippery individuals, grav-binders use microrepulsor technology to artificially apply the effects of extreme gravity to a captive. Unlike magna-cuffs, heavy-duty binders that employ a magnetic field to be too strong to break, AL-DR8 grav-binders are fitted snugly across the body and use the power of gravity itself to restrict any movement. This makes them favorable for species that have especially flexible or even amorphous bodies, as they must be able to muster the strength to resist the artificial gravity created by the grav-binders before they can even attempt to slip free.
[P]Breaking free from the grav-binders requires the [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Athletics check[b] (due to the restrictive effects of the artificially raised gravity on the whole body, a character cannot slip free of grav-binders using flexibility alone.)</Description>

      [H3]Escape Circuit[h3]

Many free droids find the notion of being placed back into servitude intolerable. While some worlds have laws preventing a free droid from being subjected to a restraining bold, many more do not, and criminals rarely let the law get in their way regardless. Most droids concerned about this fate simply resolve to never be caught in a situation where a restraining bolt could be applied, but some turn to trusted Droid Techs to get an escape circuit installed. These internal systems function similarly to cybernetics with the capacity to resist and even overload restraining bolts through concentrated effort.

[P]An escape circuit is a cybernetic implant that can only be installed in droids. A droid installed with an escape circuit can resist a restraining bolt with an [B]Easy ([DI]) Discipline check[b] instead of the normal difficulty (see page 178 of the [B]Edge of The Empire[b] Core Rulebook). The droid may spend [AD][AD] from a check made to resist a restraining bolt to overload the bolt, rendering it entirely useless.

      [H3]Tear of the Elders[h3]
Before humans ever came to Naboo, another starfaring species discovered the Gungans in Naboo’s swamps and seas. Little is known about these so-called “Elders” beyond what can be gleaned from the statuary they left behind on the planet and on Rori, one of the planet’s three moons. The Elders, it is theorized, were humanlike in appearance, though even that conjecture is only tenable if the enormous faces of their monuments are held to be representative of the Elders themselves, which is far from certain. Another theory, based on certain features of the faces, holds that the Elders were Force users. This would seem even more tenuous than other beliefs concerning their physiology, were it not for the existence of a Force artifact known as the Tear of the Elders.
[P]Long treasured by the Gungans, the Tear of the Elders is a fist-sized piece of granitic rock, shaped, as its name suggests, in a teardrop formation. Teams of Gungan geologists and artisans who analyzed the Tear uncovered three crucial facts. First, it is formed of the same substance the Elders used in their statues, a rock matrix native to Naboo and its moons. Second, none of the hundreds of known examples of Elder statuary depict tears. Finally, unlike the monumental statues, the Tear has no toolmarks of any kind. These facts, along with the Tear’s shape, would suggest that it is an unlikely, but not impossible, naturally occurring stone form, were it not for the widely known legend about it.
[P]According to this legend (Gungan scholars insist that it is historical truth, though they can offer no documentary evidence supporting their claim), sometime in the long years between the departure of the Elders and the first visits to Naboo by humans, the Gungan people adopted the relics of the Elders into their religion in practices that continue to this day. The isolated monuments of the Elders are considered holy sites, and they are venerated as places of great power. It was at one of these sites—the Gungans do not say which, specifically—that the event they call “Tearfall” occurred.
[P]Force sensitivity is neither rarer nor more frequent among the Gungans than the galactic average, so it is no surprise that before the rise of the Republic and the founding of the Jedi Order, some few Gungans evinced powers that would now be recognized as Force-based. One such Gungan, his name lost to history, was the resident guardian of an Elder statue. In the course of his meditations, this Gungan cast his awareness out into the world, eventually becoming so skilled that he could sense events over the whole surface of Naboo, and even beyond. On the day he sat before the Elder statue and sensed the first human scout ships entering orbit, a great and unaccountable grief overcame the Gungan mystic. When he looked up, he saw a gray tear impossibly welling up in the stone face he sat before. Holding out his hand, he caught the Tear of the Elders in his hand as it fell.</Description>

Frangawl cultists are masters of dark side techniques, including ones that deal with capturing and corrupting the Living Force in a sentient being. The cult practices rituals that culminate in acts of brutal sacrifice. As their victims die, Force sensitives among the cultists use tools to extract the Living Force from them. Once extracted, the energy can be used to power a ritual in progress, or it can be preserved for some future purpose.
[P]One way the cultists preserve the energy is to store it in a very fine crystalline powder. When charged with the Living Force, the powder glows with a faint blue hue. A single sacrifice typically yields several doses of Frangawl Force powder.
[P]A Force-sensitive character can consume a dose of Frangawl Force powder as a maneuver. Upon doing so, the PC gains 10 Conflict and adds automatic [DA][DA] to the PCs next Force power check during that encounter.

      [H3]Grimoire of Syclos the Lame[h3]
Whereas most citizens of other planets may believe the Force to be but a legend, on the Wild Space planet of Weik, the Force is known to exist without a doubt. Equally feared and celebrated, it is utilized by many of the world’s residents on a daily basis. It is not, however, understood in the manner propagated by the Jedi, or even the Sith. Instead, on Weik, the Force is viewed as magic.
[P]Over the centuries since the unique culture of Weik arose in the wake of a crash landing, all the trappings and mysteries associated with fantasy holodramas and children’s tales have found real-world analogs on the planet. Ignorant of how the wider galaxy sees such things, the people of Weik are familiar with what they consider to be "magical" weapons and armor, encircled objects of power ranging from clothing to tools, and even, as in the case of the legendary Grimoire of Syclos the Lame, spellbooks.
[P]Befitting its portentous name, the Grimoire is a large, leather-bound book, its cover tooled with mystic patterns, reinforced with bronze bosses, and liberally decorated with darkly sparkling gemstones. Central to the cover design is a glyph of power that only offplanet observers might recognize as a stylized, winged lightsaber. Of greater interest to most students of the Force, however, is the book’s contents.
[P]Hand sewn into a cloth binding, some eight dozen gathers of parchment form 386 closely lined pages. The source of the parchment is a minor mystery among the many that surround the Grimoire. Though the Grimoire was clearly prepared in the manner traditional on Weik—from animal skins flayed, soaked, and stretched on frames—the green- gray color of its pages suggests that the skins used were not those of any animal known to the planet. Neither is the luminous ink used in scribbling the pages of a formula replicated in any other known Weik-produced book, whether “magical” or not.
[P]The effect of the glowing amber ink against the background of gray and green would have offered a challenging reading experience even if Syclos the Lame—if she was in fact the scribe—had been an accomplished calligrapher. Unfortunately, whoever penned what have been called the book’s “mad ravings” was far more concerned with utilizing every square centimeter of available space than with legibility. It has been estimated that the Grimoire of Syclos the Lame contains more than a half-million individual words, whereas books of similar provenance and size usually contain around two hundred thousand, even when they are not so liberally embellished as the Grimoire.
[P]It is those embellishments—or rather, their many reproductions—that have given this tome its fame on Weik. Taking the form of creatures out of nightmare, the capital letters heading each page are hollow-eyed, many-limbed monsters, rendered in glowing ink that seems to cause them to move on the page. No figure is repeated across the Grimoire’s pages, yielding a fiendish menagerie of beasts that would give pause even to far-traveled big game hunters of the wider galaxy. The Beasts of Syclos, as they are popularly known, may be found copied in many other volumes, and they have even been rendered in stone as rain-spouting gargoyles on Weik’s cathedrals and castles. Large mock versions of the creatures crafted from paper and daub are carried aloft on wooden poles through Weik’s villages. This occurs at sunset on the autumnal equinox, in a celebration known as the Feast of Worms.
[P]But for all its local fame, the Grimoire has been little studied by the sages of Weik. The peculiarities of its production and the nigh-indecipherable scrawl of its scribbling would be daunting enough, but Weik is a place where legends are given great credence, and according to legend, to read the
words of Syclos the Lame is to invite madness. The secrets it unlocks are said to be sorely tempting for the power they offer, but the ultimate promise of the lame wizard’s teachings is death. The Grimoire’s information is said to be applicable to beasts across the galaxy, not just those located on Weik.
[P]Studying the Grimoire of Syclos the Lame for at least one hour allows a Force-sensitive character to add [FO] to all Force power checks or checks involving Force talents when dealing with creatures detailed in the Grimoire. The bonus lasts until the end of the game session. (What creatures the bonus applies to is ultimately up to the GM, as some creatures may not be covered in the Grimoire.)
[P]However, until the end of the game session, the difficulty of all fear checks made while confronting these creatures is upgraded twice. Any Conflict generated by a [DE]  result on a fear check is doubled.

Some Slicers make use of a rare and highly illegal set of droid modifications to mask their slicing signatures by routing them through a drois's systems, which fill the signature with junk data from the droid's base-level processes. These systems can either be made to link up with an external set of slicing tools, or they can be part of an internal suite of devices that allow the droid on which they are installed to slice into systems independently. Droid Slicers who have this upgrade installed can make use of it in their own slicing endeavors, making them particularly pernicious opponents for even skilled administrators.
[P]A networked slicing uplink is a cybernetic implant that can only be installed in droids. in addition to its other effects, it counts as a set of slicer gear (see page 179 of the [B]Edge of The Empire[b] Core Rulebook).

      [H3]Dram of Orphne[h3]
The curious Mid Rim planet of Aleen has long been speculated to be a place with a strong natural resonance with the Force. Unusual (some would say impossible) features of the planet’s ecology, topology, and atmosphere lend credence to theories that the Force saturates the very crust of the planet, and the existence of the artifact known as the Dram of Orphne adds further support.
[P]The bifurcated world of Aleen is divided into the surface world, populated by the gregarious and relatively well- known Aleena people, and a mysterious Underworld, ruled by the towering, treelike Kindalo. The division between the two peoples and their environments is absolute. For centuries, it was thought that only the world’s massive arbozoic trees could be said to cross the boundary between the two worlds of Aleen. But during the Clone Wars, a creature out of legend revealed itself. Members of a Republic relief force encountered an Underworld being known as Orphne—neither Aleena nor Kindalo, but of some other, unknown species—a sylphlike being who spoke in riddles.
[P]When those Republic personnel found themselves trapped in the Underworld, they only escaped when they managed to puzzle out the answer to a conundrum posed in verse by Orphne. Critical to their escape was their physical location. By solving the riddle, they moved within what has come to be known as Orphne’s Fountain, a sophisticated device based on either unknown technology or on the Force itself. Orphne’s Fountain transported the trapped Republic personnel from the Underworld to the surface on a massive jet of water. A phenomenon practically unknown on the relatively arid planet, this unexpected event is well remembered by the Aleena.
[P]According to official Republic records, what happened next was relatively straightforward. A breach between Aleen’s surface and subterranean worlds was sealed, ending the groundquakes that had necessitated the Republic relief effort in the first place. However, unknown to the commanders of the clone forces on the planet, agents of then-Chancellor Palpatine had been secreted among the medical and support staff sent to their division. One of these agents, acting on standing orders to record any unusual phenomena possibly related to the Force, collected a sample of the water of Or- phne’s Fountain. The agent planned to smuggle the sample offworld to Coruscant.
[P]Why what has become known as the Dram of Orphne never made it off Aleen is unclear. It is possible that the agent was discovered and countered (or even eliminated) by either the Aleena or even the Kindalo, perhaps acting at the behest of Orphne. The vial is currently held by Aleena mystics, who have enshrined it at the center of one of the colossal statues they tend. The Aleena, unlike the Kindalo, are not known to have ever had direct contact with Orphne, but they nevertheless hold the Dram sacred, using it as a focus of unusually efficacious healing rituals.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses the Dram of Orphne heals 1 additional strain at the end of an encounter. A Force-sensitive character who possesses the Dram of Orphne also heals 1 additional wound when benefiting from natural rest. Finally, when making a Medicine check to heal another character, any character with the Dram of Orphne may add [BO] to the check.

Equal parts formal attire from a variety of worlds and
functional military uniform, an assortment of dress
uniforms are worn for ceremonial purposes by Alliance
Military personnel. Like standard working uniforms
within the Alliance Military, dress uniforms are a mix of Imperial military surplus and the uniforms of
the various Alliance member species. While they do
exist, official dress uniforms are rarely worn by Alliance
personnel due to the lack of common standards
and a reluctance by some cultures to give up the
traditions and trappings of their own militaries. This
is slowly changing, however, as the Alliance Military
becomes more organized and uniform guidelines filter
down from High Command.

Sulfur is a very common element, broadly available across the galaxy. Devaronians have a unique reaction to the material.

When inhaled, the sulfur moves into the bloodstream quickly and travels throughout the body.

      [H3]Herder's Gauntlet[h3]
The Iktotchi people are blessed with the talents of precognition, an ability found to benefit from augmentation by the Force when their world was incorporated into the Republic thousands of years ago. Though their natural talent for foretelling the future fades exponentially the farther they travel from their home moon, Iktotchi Force sensitives, particularly among the Jedi, formulated many techniques to expand and refine their native precognitive abilities using the Force.
[P]One common Force power that did not come naturally to the Iktotchi, however, was the ability to move objects at a distance. Their native precognition, in other words, did not translate automatically into skill with the Force ability that mimics telekinesis. Though Iktotchi Jedi more than made up for this with their mastery of other Force talents, the Jedi Master Needa Kame saw an opportunity in the seeming shortcoming.
[P]Around 900 BBY, Needa Kame took a leave of absence from his Jedi duties and traveled to Iktotch for an extended period of meditation and study. He built a retreat in the mountains of that windswept moon, and devoted over a decade to developing the Force-imbued Gauntlet that bears his name. Exquisitely crafted from the hide and horns of a sure-footed ungulate native to the Iktotchi highlands, the Herder’s Gauntlet is, unsurprisingly, fitted for an Iktotchi, with larger fingers and a broader palm than a human’s.
[P]During his years of working on the Gauntlet, Master Kame was not completely isolated. The inhabitants of the village closest to his simple dwelling frequently made the half-day trek to visit the Jedi, bringing him food and other supplies in exchange for advice, or out of simple neighborliness. Over time, the children of the village transitioned from fearing the strange old man to adopting him as a sort of eccentric grandfather. Needa Kame did not discourage this, being possessed of both a gentle soul and a sparkling sense of humor.
[P]It was this latter quality that eventually led to the breakthrough that allowed the completion of the Herder’s Gauntlet. Through years of experimentation and tinkering, Master Kame had come frustratingly close to realizing his ambition of creating an aid for Iktotchi Force users unskilled at telekinesis time and time again, only to have some obstacle or oversight see him fall short. It was when the village children were visiting him on one occasion that the Jedi, wearing the Gauntlet because he had been working on it when they arrived, decided to amuse his guests with some legerdemain, showing off some perfectly mundane sleight-of-hand tricks he had learned at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in his student days. But Needa Kame fumbled the trick he was performing (pulling a local fruit from behind a small girl’s ear), earning good hearted jeers from the children. At that moment, the Jedi experienced a revelation, realizing that his Gauntlet was as advanced as it ever need be. Instead, it was his application of the Force that had been wanting. Readdressing the problem, he centered himself, held out his gauntleted hand, and lifted the delighted little girl into the air.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who wears the Herder’s Gauntlet counts as possessing the Move basic power, and may make a Move Force power action as a maneuver. A character who does so may not attack an opponent with this use of the Force power (what constitutes an attack is ultimately up to the GM, but should include disarming or incapacitating opponents as well as dealing damage).

      [H3]Crown of Verity[h3]
In the days of the Republic and even before, the Outer Rim world of Auratera, little visited now, attracted the attention of Force users from all over the galaxy. Its curious day-night cycle might have been enough to interest scouts and astronomers, but it was the presence of the powerful vergence of Acablas that drew Jedi, Sith, and other Force sensitives to the planet for millennia. Over the course of Auratera’s history, such visitors had varying degrees of success in penetrating the ruins around Acablas and coming to understand its mysteries.
[P]At least one Jedi is known to have been studying Acablas on Auratera at the time of Order 66. Though he is presumed dead, the fate of the Ithorian Master Tobar Ka-Teen is unknown. What is known is that Ka-Teen had, with the permission of the Jedi Council, carried with him to Auratera a powerful and ancient Force artifact known as the Crown of Verity.
[P]In surviving Jedi records, the so-called “Crown” is actually described as a silvered skullcap capable of altering its own size and shape so that it might be worn by any sentient possessed of a discernible head. The Crown of Verity is said to have been used as a symbol of office by the Magistrates of Benetage before that Outer Rim planet was mysteriously abandoned almost thirty thousand years ago. How it came to be held in the Jedi Temple at Coruscant is unknown. Force-sensitive beings who don the Crown find themselves simultaneously able to discern any lie and unable to utter any falsehood themselves.
[P]His final, probably fatal trip to Auratera did not mark the first occasion on which Master Tobar Ka-Teen was allowed use of the Crown. His fascination with what constitutes truth had led the philosophy-minded Ithorian to make several studies of the artifact. He sought a way to duplicate its properties in other devices, and to expand and perfect the Jedi’s already considerable innate sensitivity to falsehoods.
[P]Ka-Teen’s interest in truthtelling had a dark origin. Shortly after he was named a Jedi Master, the Ithorian fell afoul of the Black Sun criminal syndicate when he inadvertently interrupted their machinations aboard Kriost Station, a deep space trading outpost. Seeking to punish the Jedi for his interference, the Black Sun placed a bounty on Master Ka-Teen’s head, hiring a deeply corrupt human woman known as Kallyx the Piner to capture him and learn everything the Jedi Order knew about Black Sun activities by any means necessary.
[P]“Piner” is an ancient and obscure term for torturer, and the weeks Tobar Ka-Teen spent under the knives of Kallyx before his rescue by fellow Jedi tested him beyond anything he had been trained for. However, to his astonishment, the gentle Ithorian found a capacity for something he had never thought possible in himself: lying.
[P]Instead of revealing anything about Jedi operations or intelligence, Master Ka-Teen successfully wove a complex net of deception that ensnared Kallyx the Piner. Seeking to protect his fellow Jedi, Ka-Teen found his only option to be what he later described as “the abandonment of truth."
[P]Despite being hailed as a hero by the Jedi Council, the Ithorian turned deeply inward following the episode, becoming an intensely private individual who spent more time alone in the libraries and archives of Coruscant than with his fellow Jedi Knights. Tobar Ka-Teen was seeking something elemental, and that search led him first to his studies of the Crown of Verity, and then, apparently, to the mysterious vergence on Auratera in the ruins of Acablas.
[P]Though he was not a general and took little part in the Clone Wars, Ka-Teen was accompanied to Auratera by several squads of Republic troops. Order 66 was enacted during his scheduled stay on the planet, and there is no reason to believe he survived its execution. However, there is no record that the clone troops “guarding” him ever returned from Auratera, either. Thus, the planet is the last known location of the Crown of Verity, and of the Jedi Master who so desperately desired to understand its secrets.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who dons the Crown of Verity automatically fails all Deception checks while wearing it. At the same time, she gains automatic [SU][SU] [SU]  on any checks to detect lies or determine whether someone is telling the truth.

aggravated their non-droid colleagues to no end. The
majority of the T-series droids were eventually
upgraded to super tactical droids, with more efficient
systems and personality patches that reined in some
of their worst traits. Very few T-series tactical droids
are in service today, and those that are serve among

    <Description>
      [H3]Taradon's Helm[h3]
Somewhere in the icy wastes of Hum, the wreckage of a starfighter serves as the tomb of the Jedi Taradon, a Corellian human possessed of extraordinary prowess as a pilot. Taradon was a member of the Jedi Order in the early days of the Republic. If legends are to be believed, he pursued evildoers with blade and blaster for almost a century before disappearing while fighting off a raid of the Jedi-protected planet Hum.
[P]Taradon is known to have brought dozens of galactic criminals to justice, but unlike other famous Jedi Knights, he rarely met his foes face to face. Instead, he haunted the spacelanes, ghosting in and out of hyperspace at the controls of one of the half-dozen starfighters and gunboats he is known to have piloted. Whether acting on his own or at the behest of the Jedi Council, the human always preferred to stalk his prey while safely ensconced in a cockpit, where his preternatural skills and technical acumen eventually led him to develop the omnicompatible piloting device known today as Taradon’s Helm.
[P]Though many shipwrights and pilots have heard tales of the Helm, few could venture to describe its physical characteristics, much less its functions. The Helm is known to have been human-portable; hot-swappable into the hardware of dozens, if not hundreds, of different ship types; and capable of integrating piloting, navigation, and weapon systems into a discrete, maddeningly complicated interface. What is less well known is that Taradon imbued his unique invention with secret crystalline technologies that tap into the Force, enabling those who use it to channel their courage and wisdom into extraordinary acts of piloting derring-do.
[P]In fact, the device now called the Helm (it is unknown by what name Taradon referred to it) is relatively small and bears more resemblance to a modern slicer’s gear than to surviving examples of early Republic starship control mechanisms. It takes the form of a control box studded with switches, buttons, and indicator lights, roughly rectangular but tapering to a conical point on one side. This cone, along with the leads that extend from it, is the interface point that connects Taradon’s Helm to the controls of almost any craft capable of flight, from simple atmospheric hoppers to interstellar dreadnoughts. The design is wickedly clever, with multiple methods available to connect the Helm to a ship, accounting for the mind- boggling array of craft it could augment.
[P]Reinforced and rugged, the Helm is believed to have survived the crash that took Taradon’s life on Hum. It may be seen as ironic that this ace of the spacelanes and ship’s captain without peer died in a crash, but, in fact, other survivors of the battle in the planet’s frigid skies believed that Taradon of Corellia sacrificed himself in a successful last- ditch effort to fight off a force led by turncoat Jedi raiding for kyber crystals.
[P]Taradon was flying in close action against a starfighter piloted by a rogue Jedi when they entered orbit around Hum. The traitor pilot was a Rodian Jedi turned assassin named Deelguh, whom Taradon had trained with as a young Padawan. Taradon had long sought to bring Deelguh to justice, only to be stymied time and again, as the Rodian was his near-equal as a pilot. Knowing that the fearsome fighter would become yet more dangerous if the raiding mission succeeded, Taradon knew the raid must be stopped. With Deelguh’s ship about to land, having successfully fought off Taradon’s attacks, the Corellian apparently chose to bring both vessels down in a fiery collision. Presumably unable to eject or unwilling to leave his ship behind, Taradon rode his burning craft all the way down to the surface, to his death. He died secure in the knowledge that Deelguh had also met his end.
[P]Expeditions to investigate the crash site were never successful in locating the wrecked ship, but a careful examination of Taradon’s transmitted flight logs revealed an unidentifiable surge of energy coming from the Corellian’s navicomputer moments before his death. The Jedi who reviewed the logs theorized that it might have been a function of the legendary Taradon’s Helm, fighting to protect its master, a conclusion scoffed at by others, who said the Helm would never have disobeyed a command.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses Taradon’s Helm may reroll one [FORCE] when making checks that involve piloting or using a starship or vehicle. If there is some question as to whether the check involves piloting or using a starship or vehicle, the CM is the final arbiter.</Description>

Alliance Commanders hail from numerous human, nearhuman,
and alien cultures from throughout the galaxy.
From contemplative, level-headed Mon Calamari, to
cunning Bothans, to dangerously capricious humans of
every stripe, Commanders who join the Alliance bring
with them generations of their native military culture
and heritage. In most of these cultures, commanding
officers and highly ranked NCOs carry some item
about their person that represents their lawful command
over their subordinates. This could be anything
from a ceremonial saber worn with a dress uniform, to
a megaphone used to broadcast commands, to a stuncrop
used to motivate sluggish troopers. Whatever the
item, it symbolizes the power of an individual’s command,
and the Commander is rarely found without it.
[P]No matter what form the item takes, Commanders
carrying a symbol of command add [BO] to all Social
skill checks made to interact with others brought up
in their particular military culture.</Description>

      [H3]CZ-88 Heavy Loader Arm[h3]
The CZ-88 model heavy loader produced by Czerka is a flexible piece of equipment used for everything from moving freight to collecting salvage to replacing damaged hull plating on starships. The primary loading arm has several extensions that enhance articulation and balance allowing it to handle even delicate materials without sacrificing the lifting power needed for large-scale construction and salvage jobs. It generally comes mounted on a cart with a repulsorlift as transporting the arm would otherwise be largely impractical due to its enormity.
[P]A heavy loader arm includes a monotask droid brain that can perform checks to heft objects; it has an Athletics skill of 1 and a Brawn of 5 (if unassisted, it rolls [PR][AB][AB][AB][AB] for Athletics checks.
[P]Sometimes, salvages install loader arms directly onto starships or other vehicles for easy retrieval of scrap metal and other components, using the arm as a low-cost alternative to a tractor beam projector. A CZ-88 heavy loader arm can be installed onto a vehicle of silhouette 3 or larger as an attachment, and uses one hard point. The occupants of the craft can use it to perform Athletics checks to lift objects into or out of the vessel (and other checks at the GM's discretion) without disembarking.

      [H3]Eyes of Laqasa[h3]
The Jedi Knight Laqasa Trill was a Devaronian woman and an incredibly skilled hunter, excelling at an activity more often practiced by Devaronian men. Trill was an exemplar of the philosophy of hunting that ecologists promote, carefully choosing her marks from overpopulated game species or stalking the rare rogue predators that target sapients. She insisted that hunting was a meditative act, and she claimed to owe her phenomenal success to the Force-enabled connection she shared with her quarry.
[P]Although she was an accomplished Jedi, Trill was careful never to use the order’s signature weapon, her lightsaber, in the hunt. Instead, she adopted the tools and weapons of the local hunters in whatever environment she found herself, thus mastering a dizzying array of techniques and technologies. She was not above modifying the accoutrements she came across in her travels, however, and at least one example of her tinkering is thought to have survived to the present day. Rumored to be stored in a hunting lodge deep in Devaron’s Blue Mountains, the Force-imbued goggles known as the Eyes of Laqasa miniaturize the functions of high-end electrobinoculars within a pair of crystalline lenses set into a leather headband. It is those crystal lenses, and the powers the Jedi invested in them, that mark the Eyes of Laqasa as a powerful Force artifact.
[P]The particular impetus for the invention of the Eyes of Laqasa is a Devaronian legend. Late in Laqasa Trill’s life, a male hunter secretly and illegally imported a troop of large predators that shared the characteristics of simians and reptiles. Their world of origin is unknown to this day, but what made the animals unique, even more than their viciousness, was their Force-enabled chameleon ability, a trait that had evolved in the beasts to such an extent that they were practically invisible in natural surroundings. The hunter released the troop into a supposedly enclosed hunting sanctuary, which they promptly escaped after slaying their would-be killer and his game wardens.
[P]For the next two years, the troop wreaked havoc on the ecosystem of Devaron’s northern continent, ranging far and wide and eluding the finest hunters on the planet. It was then that Laqasa Trill arrived, making one of her infrequent visits to her homeworld. When she learned of the situation, she vowed to end the threat posed by the alien predators once and for all. Taking only what she could carry on her back, the idiosyncratic huntress disappeared into the wilderness.
[P]The Jedi was never known to take trophies except for this instance. When she returned to civilization over a year later, she wore an ankle-length, color-shifting cloak woven from the hides of her prey. She also wore a set of goggles she had constructed in the course of her hunt, and she recorded in her journals that she owed not only her success to the Eyes, but her very life.
[P]When wearing the Eyes of Laqasa, Force-sensitive characters remove all [SE] imposed due to darkness, concealment, camouflage, or similar effects, and can see normally as if in normal daylight.

    <Description>
      [H3]Bardottan Sphere[h3]
One of the most powerful objects ever encountered by the legendary Jedi Master Mace Windu was the Bardottan Sphere, a Force artifact designed to capture the Force from living beings and store it as though in some battery. The Sphere could focus the captured energy into a Force wielder when certain mystical and gravitational effects were applied. Now held by the Dagoyan mystics of Bardotta, the Sphere became known on that planet when Master Windu rescued the Bardottan sovereign, Queen Julia, from the clutches of the Nightsisters, an organization of dark side Force adepts.
[P]Whether the Nightsisters constructed the Sphere or discovered it is unknown, and the Bardottans have denied all requests to access the studies of the artifact that might reveal its provenance. Exhaustive records searches have found no mention of such an item either before or since Windu’s encounter with the Nightsisters. It seems likely the item is unique and was crafted by the Nightsisters or their allies shortly before its use during the events surrounding the kidnapping of Queen Julia.
[P]In appearance, the Sphere is not particularly notable. It takes the form of a large crystalline sphere of milky transparency, its color dependent on the light it reflects. It is only when a Force-sensitive being attuned to the Sphere wills it to a semblance of mineral life that the Sphere glows with an internal light and works its “magic.” When activated in this manner, the Sphere forms a link with a nearby living creature, as directed by the controlling Force sensitive. In theory, this could be any living being, as the Force surrounds and penetrates all things, but in practice, the Nightsisters and their minions seem to have chosen only sentients as their targets. Once the link has been established, the Sphere cuts off the target’s connection with the Force and then drains the Force contained within the target’s living self, leaving behind a husk bereft of life. The exact mechanisms of this process are, as with so many Force artifacts, unclear. The Sphere is obviously not mechanical in nature, and neither can it be said to be living. It has been theorized that the Sphere, when inert, is in fact a sort of anti-Force artifact, cut off from the universe and reflecting the all-surrounding Force away from itself. If this is true, say those who hold this theory, then a type of “Force vacuum” exists within the bounds of the Sphere, one that naturally attracts the Force when the Sphere becomes active.
[P]The Nightsisters did not use the Sphere as a simple tool of execution, however. The Sphere not only drains the Living Force from its victims, but also stores what it has stolen for a time. The Nightsisters could then tap into that stored Force, using it to fuel any number of Force powers to much
greater effect than they could on their own. The Bardottan Sphere, then, is a power booster for Force users, its power being purchased at the ultimate price, paid by those its users have targeted.
[P]In its history and recorded use, the Sphere of the Nightsisters has been understood as a tool of evil and murder. To be sure, there is little to suggest that it was created with anything but the literal theft of life in mind. However, at least some of the Dagoyan mystics who guard the Sphere today are said to have taken on a more curatorial role, studying the Sphere with an eye toward using its considerable powers in a benign way, more in keeping with their relatively peaceful philosophies. These Bardottans have begun to agitate for more access to the Sphere, arguing that if they can plumb its mysteries, they can control its effects, and perhaps find ways to utilize its curious binary nature as an object that sometimes reflects the Force and sometimes absorbs it. The discussion about whether to pursue this course of action usually ends there, though, as those who wish to activate the Sphere have thus far been unable to formulate detailed plans for its use that meet with the approval of Bardotta's sovereign and the Dagoyan council. The activist scholar-mystics argue that they must first be allowed greater access to the Sphere before they can provide any such details, but their requests have been denied as being too fraught with potential danger.
[P]While the Sphere is in a character’s possession, the character’s Force rating increases by one. If the character sacrifices a living being to store its life force in the Sphere, then the character’s Force rating increases by the Force rating of the sacrificed being, as long as that creature’s Force rating was 1 or higher. However, a character who uses the Sphere during a session gains 5 Conflict at the at the end of the session, in addition to any Conflict accrued due to any sacrifices the character makes to power the Sphere.

Developed by Coruscant-based boutique electronics
firm Farbreini MicroElectronics Ltd., the BPEA-IA Cascader
was designed to give those who live in the public
eye an extra level of control over their appearance. A
relatively simple and elegant piece of electronic wizardry,
the Cascader is a small, low-powered holoprojector
connected to a patented projection matrix called
the electronic molecular excitation net (EME Net).
The projector is typically built into a piece of jewelry
or, in the case of models used by military officers, into
medals or decorations on a dress uniform. The EME
Net is a lightweight, unobtrusive mesh of photoreceptors
and photoreactive materials sewn into specially
prepared clothing, such as uniforms and fancy dress
outfits. When activated, the Cascader creates a subtle
holographic effect that enhances both the features and
voice of the wearer, increasing charisma and attractiveness.
It allows wearers to tweak the shape of their face
and the positions of their features, change the color
of their eyes, adjust the tone and texture of their skin,
alter the tenor of their voice, and make a number of
other small adjustments to their appearance.
[P]When wearing a Cascader, a PC upgrades all Charm,
Deception, and Leadership checks he makes once.

      [H3]Dolina Ring Seeds[h3]
The swampy world of Dagobah has been erased from galactic charts, but the rare visitors of times past brought away samples of the planet’s unique flora and fauna. One example from Dagobah’s extensive catalog of vegetative wonders is the dolina ring seed, samples of which are held by several universities and agribusiness concerns throughout the galaxy. Although the samples’ provenance is now unknown, their unusual shape and mysterious properties continue to be studied by scientists.
[P]The seeds are just that, embryonic plants forming both the culmination and the beginning of the life cycle of an unknown angiosperm. However, unlike the vast majority of coated seeds that have been cataloged from across known space, dolina ring seeds are not spherical or ovoid. Instead, the hardened fruit layer, or endocarp, surrounding and fused to the actual seed material takes the form of a woody ring about three centimeters in diameter. This unique shape has long fascinated biologists, who seek to learn what form of plant might grow from a ring. However, no dolina ring seeds have ever germinated away from the soggy soils of Dagobah, so no one now living knows what manner of shrub, flowering plant, or tree might grow from them.
[P]Normally, thus stymied, scientists would turn their attention to some other wonder, but the dolina ring seeds have characteristics that make them fascinating on their own. For one thing, they are near-indestructible, capable of withstanding tremendous pressures, extremes of temperature, and baths of caustic and corrosive chemicals with little or no physical evidence of trauma to their outer coatings. Another property unusual in a clearly biological artifact is the seeds' extraordinary density. Though small enough to be held in the palm of a human’s hand, and even of a size and shape appropriate to be worn as jewelry on some sentients’ fingers, dolina ring seeds mass in at an incredible nine kilograms on average, making them some of the heaviest known plant matter.
[P]There is another characteristic of dolina ring seeds, known to only the very few Force-sensitive scientists who have studied them, kept as a closely guarded secret. Their Force reactivity was first discovered and described by a Sullustan agronomist in the employ of a Mid Rim foodstuffs company just a few years after the end of the Clone Wars. All of this scientist’s research, and the scientist herself, were promptly confiscated by agents of the Empire. Around the same time, a human farmer and chemist working independently came across a dolina ring seed in a lot of seed stocks he had purchased as part of a load of salvage from a Trandoshan junk dealer. Unaware of the scant findings that had been published about the ring seeds, this man at first kept the sample as a simple curiosity. It was only when an Imperial sweep of his planet for Force sensitives targeted his young daughter that the ring’s value became apparent.
[P]Seeking to protect his daughter from Inquisitorial kidnapping, the farmer hid her in his laboratory while he tried to convince the Imperial agents that she was offworld with her mother. A quick records check showed the agents that the farmer was in fact a widower, and then the casual brutality of the Empire evinced itself as they shot the man in cold blood. Overhearing the execution, the girl cast about desperately for anything that might save her, and it was then that the innate Force abilities that had attracted the attention of the Inquisition in the first place reacted with the dolina ring seed. Sensing that she should do so, and ignoring its incredible weight, the girl slipped the seed onto her thumb. The energy of the Living Force filled her body, taking the form of an incredible burst of speed. The Imperial agents saw only a blur as she fled into the night, never to be seen by them again.
[P]Now a grown woman, Syla Trasker is an accomplished Force adept and a member of the Rebellion. She still wears the dolina ring seed her father found, now on a chain around her neck, its weight unfelt and thus no hindrance. It gives her the ability to run at tremendous Force-granted speeds, though such efforts are only sustainable for a short time and are exhausting. Tests performed by Syla and Rebellion scientists show that both the variable weight and the speedgranting properties of the seed are only active when it is held by a Force-sensitive being.
[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses a dolina ring seed may perform one free Move maneuver during each of his turns. This Move maneuver may be in addition to any other maneuvers performed this turn and can allow the character to perform three maneuvers in a turn. (The user also ignores the ring seed’s weight.)

Longsight is a rare substance, extracted from caves beneath Aleen's surface. In concentrated doses, the drug is lethal to all known species. However, when strongly diluted, the material has an inexplicable effect upon sentient beings. As long as the drug remains within the system—normally until the end of an encounter—an individual’s will becomes extraordinarily potent and focused. Although the user suffers intense mental strain, for some the benefits outweigh the costs.
[P]A dose of longsight is typically injected directly into the bloodstream as a maneuver. Once injected, the character increases her Willpower by 1 until the end of the encounter. However, at the beginning of each of her turns until the end of the encounter, she suffers 2 strain.</Description>

When hooked into existing or newly installed enhancements, the regulator redirects natural bioelectricity flows to work with the power supplies of artificial limbs or to supplement the functioning of pieces that add new capabilities to the user's body. The regulator is thoroughly integrated with the autoimmune responses of the body as well, preventing them from rejecting even the most copious of upgrades.
[P]A biofeedback implant regulator increases the character's cybernetic implant cap by two (see page 173 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook). A biofeedback regulator does not count toward the character's cybernetic implant cap. Biofeedback regulators cannot be installed on droids and characters can only have a single biofeedback regulator cybernetic installed.

      [H3]Repulsor Assist Unit[h3]
Som models of grappling hook and climbing harness rely on forces other than sheer muscle power for operation Repulsor assist units use a miniaturized repulsorlift generator to make whatever they bear nearly weightless, be it a live user climbing a sheer wall, or a bale of cargo attached to the integrated hook via magnets clamp and hauled up by retractable cables. A typical model is highly compact, consisting of a small metal case that stores both the wound up cables and the lift generator, with a small hook or magnetic clamp clipped to the side.
[P]A character using a repulsor assist unit reduces the difficulty to climb by 2 (to a minimum of 0). A repulsor assist unit can also be attached to a cargo to reduce the encumbrance value of the cargo by 7.</Description>

      [H3]Foot Speeder[h3]
These curious contraptions combine the swiftness of a speeder car with an ease of storage and simple construction that makes keeping and maintaining them much less expensive than doing so for an actual vehicle. Foot speeders are constructed around a repulsorlift pad large enough for a single being to stand upon, with a steering vane extending up that doubles as a support for the occupant to hold arms.
[P]A foot speeder allows a person to function as a Silhouette 1, Speed 1, Handling -1, System Strain Threshold 4 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. It has a flight ceiling of five meters.
[P][I]Note: This item is also included as a vehicle.[i]

This high-output stun weapon takes the form of a flat lens small enough to conceal in the palm of a hand. This compact construction, though, restricts its use in actual combat due to the limits of its power storage. Instead, the owners of these devices typically use them to incapacitate an unaware target with a careful application.
[P]A character can use a palm stunner on an unaware target with an [B]opposed Skulduggery versus Resilience check[b]. A successful check automatically incapacitates a minion, or deals 12 damage to the strain threshold of a rival or nemesis. In addition, each [SU] on the Opposed Stealth check increases the damage dealt by 1.

      [H3]Scramble Key[h3]
Breaking into a facility secured with an electronic lock usually requires a knowledgeable slicer, but the galactic underworld has invented myriad ways to perform the task in the absence of such personnel. Scramble keys, also called lottery keys or luckbreakers, are one such tool. Scramble keys interact with electronic locks that require a password or code input to open. instead of providing or faking the legitimate entry code, scramble keys cycle through  possible codes at incredible speeds, offering up a barrage of possible matches in fractions of a second.
[P]The processing power is such that they are typically able to generate potential matches faster than they can input all of them. Some criminals calim that it is possible to notice when a scramble key generates the correct code through faint tremors or buzzing in the device, even if the key has not yet input this code, and that they can adjust the controls to allow them to select the correct code for immediate input. This procedure can be less effective, but could save valuable time if the operator's hunch is correct. many Force-sensitive users find they have a special knack for this approach and can intuitively select correct codes with ease.
[P]A scramble key bypasses most simple electronic locks within five minutes of application. At the Game Master's discretion, more complicated locks may require additional time to crack or might trigger alarms at the brute force incursion. The user may attempt to speed up this process with a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b], relying on pure intuition to select the correct code from those the scramble key generates. Success reduces the time needed to crack a common lock to a single minute, but failure immediately triggers any relevant alarms. Force-sensitive characters may make a Force power check as part of this check, adding either  [SU] or [AD] for each [FP] generated.</Description>

      [H3]TC-SC Infiltration Droid[h3]
Produced by Cybot Galactica and marketed primarily to government and military intelligence agencies, TC-SC droids are frighteningly effective tools for espionage, infiltration, and assassination. Particularly inconspicuous-looking, they stand just under two meters tall and appears to be normal third-degree droids, such as protocol models or teaching units. They have spindly limbs; an oversized, humanoid head with a featureless faceplate; and set of four small, red photoreceptors. These droids come in a variety of gender programming options, and their personalities are usually quiet and conciliatory. THey seem, at first glance, to be simple, uncomplicated droids going about their drudgery with little fanfare. Which, of course, is exactly what their designers want.
[P]Their innocuous looks and seemingly meek personalities are only one of the myriad of weapons the TC-SC droids utilize. They are deadly and cunning, easily equal to the best espionage agents in the ISB. Their programming includes not only intelligence and counterintelligence techniques, but also stealth, infiltration, combat, assassination, and even acting and mimicry. The most potent weapon, however, is the powerful CQ-3.80 multispectrum disguise suite that shroud them in a nearly foolproof holographic disguise. This allows TC-SC droids to take on the appearance of nearly any species in the galaxy. Combined with their programming, and given time to observe and study a target, these droids can even impersonate specific individuals.
[P]While they are quite effective and dangerous, TC-SC droids are, thankfully, relatively rare. Their systems—though powerful—are delicate, and the droids require constant maintenance. They also require memory wipes more often than other droids due to quirks in their programming. Without the regular maintenance and memory wipes, some TC-SC droids have lost themselves in their disguises and come to believe that they are actually who or what they were last impersonating. On a few rare occasions, these droids have gone rogue and disappeared. At least two ISB TC-SC droids have deserted their missions in the Outer Rim in the last decade and remain at large in the galaxy following their own whims.</Description>

      [H3]MI-Series Security Droid[h3]
Holowan MEchanicals' imposing MI-series security droids are some of the most efficient and dangerous droids in the galaxy. A recent entry into an already crowded security droids field, Holowan made its new droids stand out by arming them to their metaphorical teeth and targeting them heavily among wealthy civilians and small planetary governments. Its plan paid off, and within a scant few years it had a nearly two-year waiting list for new MI-series models.
[P]At first glance, MI-series droids look more like a frontline combat droids than private security units. They stand just over two meters tall and are covered in thick plasteel armor of a type usually found in heavy battle hardsuits and power-assisted armor. They have two heavy duty front legs that end in broad feet, and a small, armored head fitted with two large, red photoreceptors. Their most striking features are the two sets of arms mounted to their torso.
[P]The upper arms, which are mounted to the droid's shoulders, are proportional to the size of the droid. Each of these arm ends in a powerful weapon cluster that includes a pair of light repeating blasters and a pair of short-range stun blasters. The lower arms are huge, seeming much larger than the droid's chassis should be able to support and end in a  pair of massive, powerful hands, each with two fingers  and an opposable thumb. The weapons loadout, multitude of arms, and very aggressive programming with which these droids are equipped makes them incredibly formidable opponents.
[P]MI-series droids have stern humorless personalities and are given to barking orders and making bold declarations. Their voices have a deep, resonant tone that heightens their intimidation factor. They are programmed to close quickly with non-hostiles invading their personal space while warning or ordering them away from some forbidden area. Very few individuals in the galaxy can withstand having a two-meter tall heavily armed very angry droid looming over them while demanding they leave an area lest the droid open fire. MI-series droids that go for too long without a memory wipe tend to develop disturbing, almost sadistic personality traits and can become unhinged and dangerous without constant upkeep. At least one of these powerful droids, a unit designated MI-726, is known to have gone rogue and taken up a life of anti-Imperial crime.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Guardian Police Droid[h3]
GU-series "Guardian" police droids were the primary law enforcement droids operated by the Coruscant Security Force during the final years of the Republic. Designed and built by Cybot Galactica specifically for the CSF, countless thousands of these droids patrolled the sprawling upper levels of Coruscant's Galactic City for generations. While in service, GU-series droids gained a reputation as solid and levelheaded, if unimaginative, law enforcers. They were programmed for various police work, such as patrol, peacekeeping, crime scene investigation, detective work, and riot control. Although they were reliable, the GU-series droids suffered from a lack of initiative. Clever or dedicated criminals could usually outhink them with little difficulty.
[P]Guardian police droids stand just under two meters tall. They have roughly human proportions, with long dexterous arms powerful legs, and a round head with gold-colored photoreceptors. Their heads are capped with a tall, cap-like structure reminiscent of a shako or kepi, complete with a short brim over their photoreceptors, this structure houses sensors and a powerful communications suite. The droids are  often painted dark blue with silver and white accents, with a CSF badge painted on their left chest plate. When on patrol, Guardians are typically armed with a BlasTech SS-410 Police Spcial blaster pistol and a simple truncheon. Depending on the situation, they can also be equipped with stun batons, grenade launchers, riot shields, and blaster rifles.
[P] By the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire, most Guardian droids were phased out of operation with the CSF.  Replaced by Stormtroopers and newer-model, more aggressive droids, surplus GU-series droids were sold off to other worlds, reassigned to lower-priority sectors, or simply scrapped. Some can still be found patrolling the lower levels of the Imperial capitol, however. Many of these veteran droids have not had a memory wipe in decades and some have even developed very distinct personalities similar to no-nonsense police officers. They still serve the people of Coruscant, but most are entirely too old and outdated to be carrying out actual police duties.</Description>

      [H3]DUM-Series Pit Droid[h3]
Produced in huge numbers by Serv-O-Droid, the ubiquitous DUM-series droids are a common sight in workshops mechanics' garages and racing pits all across the galaxy. Introduced during the days of the Galactic Republic these droids were constructed at the Serv-O-Droid facility on Cyrillia for labor repair, and light construction use. Through out the decades during which the DUM series has been in service these droids have gained an unfortunate reputation as poorly programmed, hapless and clumsy things that are often not worth the trouble of keeping. They are also highly  disposable, thanks to their cheap construction and low price point, most DUM-series droids are simply destroyed or recycled when damaged rather than repairing. Scrapyards throughout the galaxy are littered with the remains of DUM-series droids, and few individuals consider them to have worth at all.
[P]Despite their reputation and common prejudices against them DUM-series droids are quite capable within the narrow range of their abilities DUM-series droids stand roughly one meter high. They have a spindly almost skeletal appearance, with long, thin limbs and agile digits. They have a broad, flared dome-shaped head dominated by a single large, round photoreceptor equipped with multi-spectrum scanners that detect microscopic damage in metals and other solid materials. Designed to work in large packs, they are equipped with a built-in comm system that includes a constant data link allowing groups of the droids to work together more efficiently and effectively without vocal communications. In addition, DUM-series droids can lift and carry weights well out of proportion to their tiny size. When deactivated, DUM-series droids can fold up into rough cubes covered by their broad heads this allows them to be stored and shipped easily. They can also use this mode to protect themselves from danger such as crashing vehicles or falling debris.
[P]While not particularly well liked by the general galactic population or well supported by Serv-O-Droid, DUM-series droids are still a common sight in the galaxy. They are especially popular in the Outer Rim, where their relative strength and mechanical programming make them excellent assistants to poorer shipwrights and vehicle builders. DUM-series droids are also closely associated with Podracing, nearly every Podracing team keeps a stable of these droids to maintain their vehicles and salvage scrap from crashed competitors along racecourses.</Description>

Riding tack is a catchall term for the assorted bits of equipment needed to ride or control a beast. Produced by companies like Piccatech Ltd. and VeTech, tack comes in a variety of styles tailored to the physiology of nearly every known domesicable beast in the galaxy. Riding tack includes a sturdy comfortable saddle designed for a specific beast and riding style, stirrups, headgear (bridle, halter, bit, reins, etc,), and a breastplate. Tack made for working animals replaces the saddle with a heavy duty harness that allows a creature to pull cargo sleds or implements such as plows.
[P]Tack can only be worn by riding or working animals. Using tack allows a character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties detailed on page 73.
[P][I]Note: This tack can also be found as an attachment for a mount vehicle.

Traditional, projectile-throwin bow weapons are a rarity in the galaxy. They are considered even more archaic and efficient than slugthrowers, and are rarely seen outside of museums or the collections of passionate enthusiasts. Even the vaunted bowcaster used by Wookiees is an energy weapon, despite its antiquated appearance. There are times, however, when the simplicity, portability, and reliability of a bow—not to mention its near silence of operation and broad selection of ammunition types are exactly what a given situation requires.
[P]The FS19 by Field Sports is one of the better bows sold throughout the galaxy. Roughly half as long as a grown human is tall, the FS19 uses a system of pulleys and cams to increase an archer's leverage and strength, therefore producing a more powerful and efficient weapon in a small easy-to-use package. The bow itesle if built from plasteel-reinforced polycarbonates, which give it incredible strength, and the string is a polyfiber nylamesh weave designed to minimize stretch and sag.
[P]The basic ammunition used with the FS19 is Field Sports' Mk IV "Broadhead" arrow, which consists of a meter-long plasteel shaft with with  sharp, bladed point at one end and synthetic, spin stabilizing fletching on the other. THese arrows are cheap to replace; the GM who wishes to set a price could charge 1 credit per arrow. In addition, Field Sports produces a line of other arrows for use with the FS19 that increase the weapon's versatility [B]Table 2—1: Ranged Weapons[b], on page 47, gives the base profile for the standard arrows that come with the weapon as with the profiles for the non-standard arrows for the bow.</Description>

A good kit of surveyor's tools and measuring and recording devices for plotting out and mapping, planetary surfaces. Basic kits are often more than a chain, a compass, and tool like a sextant for recording the position and movement of stars, but advanced kits used by professional surveyors can fill one or two large carrying cases or even the bed of a small speeder truck.
[P]A set of basic surveyor's tools adds [BO] to a character's Perception checks when plotting specific locations on a planet's surface, measuring distances or creating detailed maps. Larger kits may add [BO][BO] at the Game Master's discretion.</Description>

Microaxial LLC is a relatively small technology firm from the Core Worlds region that specializes in navicomputers and navigational aids. While it is known primarily as a producer of starfighter navicomputers, such as the powerful LpM-549 used on the Alliance's B-wing heavy attack fighters. It also produces a number of other navigation related products. Microaxial's products have a reputation as rugged, reliable, and easy to maintain, a reputation the company works very hard to maintain through excellent manufacturing and service.
[P]The Starmapper is a small, dedicated-use datapad designed to assist a starship's navigator in plotting courses and performing, the tricky math of hyperspace navigation. Within its prodigious memory, the Starmapper contains hyperspace and realspace maps of every known region of the galaxy. These maps are annotated and well organized, allowing a user to find a given map or star chart in an instant. Through its permanent connection to the galactic HoloNet, the Starmapper constantly upgrades its maps and charts as changes are made by the Imperial Survey Corps and by various regional and planetary survey bureaus. In addition, a Starmapper user can make changes to an existing chart and upload those changes to the HoloNet, from which other users can retrieve them and change their charts accordingly. This ensures that Starmapper users always have the latest navigational data available to them. Using a Starmapper Handheld Navicomputer grants a character [BO][BO] to all Astrogation checks. Game Masters can reduce this to [BO] or eliminate the bonus altogether if the character using the Starmapper has been out of HoloNet range for an extended period of time.</Description>

Those who live on the fringes of society, whether by choice or by circumstance, tend to be more hardy and skillful than the typical galactic citizen. Resourceful and self-reliant, these individuals often live days or even weeks from civilization, and must rely on what they can find or make by hand for daily survival. A healer's kit is simply a collection of local natural medicines kept together in a case or pouch. Depending on the users and the environments in which they live, it might contain plant back and leaves, mosses, various herbs and other natural healing agents found in the environment.
[P]Rather than being purchased, a character must fashion her own container and equip the empty pack with native medicinal items through a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Survival check[b]. A healer's kit allows the character to use the Medicine skill to heal herself or other individuals without penalty as described on page 123 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] Core Rulebook. The GM may spend [DE] on a Medicine check when  a character is using the healer's kit to indicate that some or all of the medicinal items have been exhausted in the attempt, in such a case, the healer's kit cannot be used again until the character spends some time restocking and makes an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Survival check[b].</Description>

The planet Spintir is known to xenobiologists for its curious diversity of mammalian species, but, few of its native lifeforms are as notable as the local glowbats. With a wingspan of just over a meter, the glowbats are not as physically imposing as the icewolves or powerful Spintiri lynxes that sit at the top of the planet's food chain. However, thanks to the bioluminescent, scaly flakes that collect under their wings, glowbats have managed to carve out a niche or their homeworld with few regular predators and an abundance of prey. By flapping their wings to spray the flakes forward, flowbats can disorient attackers in order to make their escape or stun prey as they swoop in for the kill.
[P]What's more, glowbats are able to regulate their bioluminescence for purposes other than predation and defense. They can dim the glow under their wings to avoid attention, or flare it in modulated sequences to communicate with each other. The last capability is used to negotiate territorial boundaries or attract mates, although some Spintiri locals believe it might be possible to train the glowbats to produce signals on command.</Description>

While they primarily feed on carrion using their talons to slice apart fallen beasts, hungry flutterplumes have been known to turn on vulnerable looking living prey in hops of an easy meal. Given the size and capabilities of these creatures an "easy meal" can mean anything from a wounded herd beast not yet fully dead to a lone sentient without obvious means of self-defense. Most flutterplume populations have learned to respect blasters but there are enough stories of bold or hungry specimens attacking isolated travelers that they have developed a fearsome reputation quite at odds with their flowery name and dazzling plumage.</Description>

Packs of quarter meter long runderen are a common sight across the seedy underbellies and slums of cities across the galaxy. Whatever planet the short-tailed rodents came from originally, their capacity for camouflage has aided them in stowing away on ships and spreading to many locations. Once established in a new habitat, packs of runderen typically seek out whatever environment offers the most abundant source of food, typically feasting on plentiful garbage across districts that cannot afford extensive fighting to expose the dark-dwelling  creatures.
[P]If allowed to flourish, runderen can become nearly impossible to eradicate. They can regulate the hue and shade of their dark coats to better blend into the shadows of any area they inhabit, thanks to an array of subdermal chemical glands. Their fur always remains dark enough to make them stand out in bright light, but provided they have even a few shadows to scurry between, they  become extremely difficult to detect, much less evict.</Description>

Although reeks are naturally herbivorous and non-aggressive, their fearsome appearance as well as great size and strength have seen them used for combat and blood sport in arenas throughout the galaxy. If left hungry, these creatures will turn to meat for sustenance, even hunting aggressively if desperate enough. In their native habitat, on Ylesia or other worlds to which they were less cruelly transplanted, reeks graze in herds. While these massive quadrupeds defend each other fiercely with huge tusks, horns and clawed feet, they remain largely docile in the absence of outside threats. Some frontier worlds have experimented with using the beasts as pack animals hoping that their hardiness and capacity for self-defence would make up for the difficulty of training them. Such attempts have had mixed success but reeks are slowly gaining a reputation as valuable, if unorthodox, steeds and beasts of burden in addition to their existing fame as combatants.</Description>

Porvir are tiny, awkward creatures. More than half of their bodies are taken up by  a bulbous rear, in which they store water and fat for the lean winter months. Their stubby legs move them at a slow waddle, and their poor vision means that they rarely find food quickly or easily, and often creatures leave behind. Despite all these disadvantages, porvir thrive across nearly every world on which they c an be found, regardless of the predatory species present—thanks to a natural affinity for the Force.
[P]Porvir have the innate ability to discourage hostile attention by using the Force in a way similar to the mind tricks that Force users sometimes employ to persuade the weak willed. While sentient beings usually have the mental fortitude to harm or capture porvir if they try, most other animals simply ignore the creatures as if they were not present, or at least  inedible. Given this unusual power, most porvir travel their habitats without any sign of fear which can make  them either unpleasant pests or easily befriended pets depending on the circumstances at hand.</Description>

Orignally native to the jungles of Cholganna, nexu have been transplanted across the galaxy since they were first discovered to be domesticable. Sometimes used as guard animals, they are far more commonly trained as arena combatants for use in gladiatorial games and challenges. They demand is driven part by their fearsome appearance with a huge toothy maw, four beady eyes and massive claw-tipped paws, all backed up by a pair of barbed tail spikes. What's more, nexu are fully as lethal as their natural armament would suggest, and possess a temperament and instinctive cunning that make them even greater threats.
[P]Although naturally stealthy and elusive, nexu do not lack for ferocity or mettle in a direct fight, and they rarely back down in the face of any threat they encounter. Even then faced with more ferocious predator, nexu are more likely to attempt to melt away into the underbrush or other cover and attack again using stealth to gain the advantage than to simply flee their hunting grounds. Of course, this means that training such fierce beasts is a dangerous and unforgiving task, but the demand for them means there are always those willing to take the risk.</Description>

Although they still can be found on other worlds one of the largest populations of the species was located in the mountains of Alderaan.

While some believe that hurghols ingest a mineral diet, as they lick or even chew at the rocks of their mountain homes. In truth they only draw in trace elements from this habit, used to strengthen their hides against harsh elements. As far as can be determined, they do not need to eat at all in the commonly understood sense, instead drawing all the energy needed to survive from the Force itself. Stories have circulated through the galaxy of incredible feats of endurance by hurghols such as falling down a steep inclines and breaking legs, then climbing out unperturbed months later after the limbs healed naturally.</Description>

The spine-backed, reptilian albeks have spread to numerous worlds across the galaxy, in large part due to a single trait of the species—its complete and utter fearlessness. Though averaging less than a meter in length, albeks are stubborn and aggressive. They have been known to take the intrusion of starship or speeder into their territory as a challenge and often stow away aboard the offending vessel. Once in place, they can be quite difficult to remove as the small creatures have a fierce temper and a unique ability to anticipate blows or grabbing hands with the Force. Pinning down albeks that don;t want to be caught is all but impossible, and usually only makes them more determined to stay where they are.
[P]Some animal trainers have learned to use this stubborn attitude to train the creatures. Getting the beasts to do anything they don;t want to do is all but futile, but since albeks accept gifts of food greedily, getting them to do what the trainer wants is simply a matter of getting one to recognize the trainer's value as a provider of treats. Well-fed and placated albeks make for ferocious and territorial guard animals, and ones that are not likely to draw as much attention as larger and more obviously threatening beasts.

When trouble is spotted, the rodent-like flyers are able to alert their entire family group with a powerful shriek that disorients predators, while shielding other nearby creereen from negative effects.
[P]Animal trainers who have worked with these creatures have found that once creereen accept them or other designated individuals, the creatures can shield members of other species from their shriek as well. This trait means that while creereen are too easily frightened to serve as true guard animals, there is still a market for trained creereen or even full nesting groups that can serve as living alarm systems.</Description>

When setting a trap or infiltrating a facility, altering one's appearance grants a huge advantage. A holographic disguise matrix overlays the wielder's appearance with on stored on the device. The device—typically small enough to wear on a belt—includes a camera that can be used to record another individual's appearance to overlay on the wearer. A base model unit is capable of storing only a single disguise in memory at a time, though more sophisticated and expensive units do exist.
[P]The projected hologram must be at least marginally larger than the wearer in order to provide adequate concealment. Thus, it cannot be used to disguise a particularly large individual as a smaller one. The holograms are built around visible light. so do not grant concealment against infrared sensors or detection devices built around other energies.
[P]When using a holographic disguise matrix, the character can effectively impersonate the visual appearance of whomever the device has previously recorded. This device adds [BO][BO] to the user's Deception checks to impersonate the target and adds [SE][SE] to onlookers' Perception checks to detect the imposter.</Description>

Nearly every person and vehicle carries a comlink or a transceiver.

If a system is able to identify the transceiver codes from a particular device, that unit can be accurately traced over a great distance, even if the contents of its messages cannot be decrypted.
[P]Military organizations mount complex and sophisticated com-scans on their capital ships, which are capable of tracing signals even across subspace. More compact eversions, with substantially more limited capabilities, however, may be installed in smaller vehicles, including speeders. These are of greater interest to independent operators, who might need to track the movements of an individual or vehicle.
[P]Using a com-scan, a character can triangulate the location and movement of a known comlink or transceiver with an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Computers check[b]. The device functions out to close range on planetary scale. Prevailing atmospheric conditions or excessive background signals can reduce its efficacy.</Description>

The ability to turn a leap into an extended flight at will offers a tremendous level of tactical versatility. If an opponent fails to recognize this capacity, then the advantage becomes even more substantial. Rocket boots enable an individual to take flight on a whim, without being as bulky or as obvious as a jetpack.
[P]The convenience of their smaller size comes at a cost, however. Rocket boots cannot operate for extended periods, due to their limited cooling capacity. Furthermore, as they are worn far from a beings center of gravity, they are far more difficult to control.
[P]Rocket boots enable a person to function as a Silhouette 1, Speed 1, Handling -3, System Strain Threshold 3 vehicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. At the end of each round of activation, the rocket boots suffer 1 system strain as their fuel depletes.

Often, a hunter needs to track prey across tremendous distances. Sometimes this could be to identify a base of operations, other times it might simply be a matter of tailing a lead to a mark when the actual target's location is unknown. A homing beacon is a device that tracks a starship or its passengers and cargo even after a hyperspace jump. Homing beacons depend upon using existing HoloNet transceivers to transmit their location back to their source. Consequently, their effectiveness is sharply limited when the vehicle travels to a system that is not connected to the HoloNet.
[P]Homing beacons vary substantially in size and in their means of application. Smaller models can be thrown by hand or manually attached to their targets. Larger ones may be fired from a rifle or even a vehilce-mounted weapon to track a more distant target. The size of the homing beacon is most relevant in determining the likelihood that anyone on the target vessel might notice its presence.
[P]As long as a homing beacon is functional, the person who activated it may trace the associated target across the galaxy. No tests are required, so long as the targets travels within known systems. A homing beacon remains functional indefinitely, unless it is deactivated.</Description>

Anyone in the market for a droid of superior durability and utility who wants a chance to make a difference in a crisis would do well to consider the SBD series of assistance and rescue droids.

      [H3][I]TTS20[i]-Series Dialectic Droid[h3]
[P]Throughout the history of the galaxy, there have been many innovative approaches to education. While the inevitable march of progress has seen a veritable raft of educational and instructor droids flood the Core Worlds through the millennia, many cultures continue to advocate the ancient discipline of lecturing. One manufacturer sought to combine both approaches in a single laminanium shell. Industrial Automaton's popular TTS 15-series education and tutorial droid was modified with further dialectic and communications modules to create the TTS20, one of the most successful orator droids in the galaxy.
[P]Programmed in over a million styles and disciplines of organized argument and debate, this droid is the best foil for any being training to be a solicitor, diplomat, or negotiator. Often the pressures of its contentious programming will cause individual units to develop a particularly quarrelsome personality if their buffers are not cleared regularly. Strangely enough, however, some owners of the TTS20 series see this as an added feature and will encourage their droids to develop even greater heights of insolent confrontation.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]WPR-60 Water Purifier[h3]
[P]Nearly every known species depends upon a steady supply of water free from contaminants for basic survival. Water is heavy, bulky, and expensive to transport around the galaxy. However, purifying water can be a time-consuming and expensive process, particularly when the types of contaminants are not readily known. Every inhabited world has its own potentially deadly microorganisms, but nonliving mineral, organic, and even radioactive threats may also be present. Removing all of these requires a reliable and low-maintenance water purifier, particularly for those times when a traveler needs to make a protracted visit far from civilization. Better models are capable of extracting water from the atmosphere.
[P]A water purifier allows the user to purify enough water for one person to drink per day.</Description>

[P]Learning is accomplished much more effectively when it integrates dedicated practice time. Hologoggles enable wearers to experience an artificial environment, within which they can enjoy a realistic experience devoted to training a specific skill. Each set of hologoggles is specialized for training in a particular field of study at a predetermined level of aptitude. A course of training normally takes eight weeks to complete, at a rate of a few hours each day. When the user completes a course of study, a new set of hologoggles can be purchased to continue in that field at a more advanced level or to study in a different field.
[P]When purchasing a set of hologoggles, a character selects one non-combat skill. That skill now counts as a career skill as long as the character owns the goggles (however, at the GM's discretion, the goggles must be used for several hours a day for a period of several months to gain this bonus). A character may only receive benefits from one pair of hologoggles at a time; if he wishes to count a new skill as a career skill, he must discard the current set of hologoggles and purchase a new one.</Description>

[P]Learning is accomplished much more effectively when it integrates dedicated practice time. Hologoggles enable wearers to experience an artificial environment, within which they can enjoy a realistic experience devoted to training a specific skill. Each set of hologoggles is specialized for training in a particular field of study at a predetermined level of aptitude. A course of training normally takes eight weeks to complete, at a rate of a few hours each day. When the user completes a course of study, a new set of hologoggles can be purchased to continue in that field at a more advanced level or to study in a different field.
[P]When purchasing a set of hologoggles, a character selects one non-combat skill. That skill now counts as a career skill as long as the character owns the goggles (however, at the GM's discretion, the goggles must be used for several hours a day for a period of several months to gain this bonus). A character may only receive benefits from one pair of hologoggles at a time; if he wishes to count a new skill as a career skill, he must discard the current set of hologoggles and purchase a new one.</Description>

[P]A critical negotiation requires the complete attention of everyone taking part. The slightest distraction can be enough to misinterpret a speaker's words or body language-either of which can have disastrous results. Any suggestion of nervousness-including a sweaty brow-can have implications for the direction of the discussion. These factors dictate that personal comfort must be a critical concern for anyone involved in high-stakes meetings.
[P]This body glove is a tight-fitting layer of clothing that integrates myriad sensors with localized heating and cooling solutions. By design, a body glove is utterly undetectable: effective but silent, producing no visual or auditory cues to its activities. It provides the wearer with a level of physical comfort that helps overcome inconveniences from both climate and dress requirements.
[P]A body glove may be worn under other clothing or armor. It removes [SE] from any checks due to temperatures outside those of the wearer's preferred environment.</Description>

The selected information is customizable, and an interface device is required to manipulate it. When the goggles are used by students, an instructor can send material from a datapad to the students' goggles as appropriate, providing new information as a lesson progresses.'
[P]At the beginning of an encounter, a character may select one Knowledge skill. For the remainder of the encounter, the character adds automatic [SU] to all checks he makes using that skill while wearing the data goggles. The GM may rule that a character needs to obtain specialized data files to upload into the data goggles before using them.</Description>

[P]When traveling on distant worlds, beings must always be certain that any food they eat there is compatible with their own digestive systems. Organic compounds that are flavorful and nutritious for one species can be lethal to another. A traveler who regularly interacts with new species needs a tool to identify what is safe to consume.
[P]A food analyzer quickly examines any food or drink to determine whether it is safe for consumption. These devices come with calibration settings for all major species. A physician with basic programming skills can easily adapt the device to work for other species. However, these devices are not capable of determining whether the food tastes good or not.

[P]Microorganisms, mineral structures, and forensic samples are just a few of the things that a researcher might need to examine in extremely fine detail. Key visual characteristics of objects only a few micrometers in size can provide the information necessary to solve a mystery or resolve a crisis. However, few species have the inherent ability to visually discern such details without an appropriate tool. A micro-imager solves this challenge by magnifying an object up to 100,000 times its original size, using visual light and  a variety of different sensors. The magnified object is projected in a holographic format above the imager. The hologram can be rotated, zoomed, and adjusted as needed, so that the viewer can perceive any necessary details.
[P]A micro-imager adds [BO] [BO] to any Perception, Knowledge (Lore), or Knowledge (Education), checks for which magnification of fine details can contribute to the research at hand.</Description>

A range of different sensors probe beneath a planet's surface to a depth of nearly two kilometers. These handheld devices can detect the different elements and minerals present in the strata as well as ascertaining their relative frequencies. These systems can be tuned to recognize precious minerals and ores, even estimating the quantity and trade value of deposits. Geoscanners warn users of any seismic, volcanic, or thermal activity, so that appropriate precautions may be taken. They also recognize hollow areas and subsurface water deposits, which can be crucial in choosing a location to mine.

      [H3]Model 40 Field Repulsor Hoist[h3]
The Model 40 field repulsor hoist began life as a field-expedient (aka jury-rigged) vehicle maintenance lift designed by Alliance Army mechanic Lidiah Alexakis. It is a simple device that uses small, low-output repulsors to lift a broken-down vehicle so that it can
be moved, towed, and repaired more easily. The first field repulsor hoist (FRH) was little more than a handful of mismatched repulsor coils mated to some magnetic work clamps and controlled by a homemade control box. It soon spread to motor pools and bases throughout the sector as Sgt. Alexakis worked to perfect it. Eventually, after coming to the attention of Alliance Military R&amp;D, the final version of the device was put into production as the Model 40.
[P]Production hoists consist of a set of six fist-sized lifting units that contain a repulsor coil, a power cell, and either a powerful magnet or a multi-adhesive pad. The lifting units are packed in to a shock-resistant, environmentally sealed carrying case along with a handheld control unit. To use the Model 40, an engineer simply attaches the lifting units to a vehicle or machine. Using the control unit, the trooper can move or lift the vehicle safely and effortlessly.
[P]The Model 40 can lift a vehicle as large as silhouette 4 up to two meters off the ground. When suspended, the vehicle can be pushed, pulled, or rotated (slowly) in any direction via an Athletics check with a difficulty equal to the vehicle's silhouette.</Description>

Power fences are specialized shield emitters designed to provide perimeter protection for civilian and military installations. Power fences all have a field generator at their heart. Similar to shield generators found on starships, power fence generators produce a wall of energy that prevents objects and energy beams from passing through it. Each generator is hooked up to a series of thin durasteel amplifier pylons with flared stresscrete bases that come in heights of up to five meters. Once activated, the generators produce walls of crackling, translucent, blue-white energy that extend between the pylons, creating a solid barrier. Power fences are typically flanked with an alloy or plascrete gate, vehicle obstacles, and weapon emplacements to provide perimeter security at both Alliance and Imperial military installations.
[P]The PSF Mk III power fence by DefenStar Ltd. is a popular small-scale power fence perfect for defending small platoon or company-sized installations. It comes complete with a high-output PFL-99 Barricade power fence generator and twenty amplification pylons, each four meters tall.
[P]Power fences can be destroyed by either attacking the energy walls with ion weapons or by attacking the amplification pylons with regular energy or slugthrowing weapons. When attacked, power fences have the following profile: Defense 2, Armor I, Wound Threshold (pylons) 15, Strain Threshold (energy wall) 20.</Description>

      [H3]Surveyor's Equipment[h3]
The first step in building anything on a planet is a good land survey, so most Alliance engineers are trained in equipment to aid in this task. Basic surveyor gear is often little more than a laser measurement system for calculating distance, macrobinoculars, a device for determining the position and movement of stars, a length of chain, and a compass. More advanced sets include various ground and terrain scanners, survey remotes, specialized hand tools, seismic recorders, and all manner of esoteric equipment.
[P]Surveyor's equipment adds [BO][BO] to a character's Perception checks when determining locations on a planet's surface, measuring distances, plotting settlements or bases, and creating detailed planetary maps.</Description>

Built by Regalis Engineering, the Breaker is a massive, long-handled hydrospanner nearly a meter long. It is built of heavy reinforced alloys and has a forged, hydraulic-assisted head that can be adjusted to fit most common fasteners. The long handle allows for the application of extra leverage on a stuck fastener, and the tool's sturdy build prevents stripping, warping, and breaking. Most field mechanics keep at least one Breaker in their toolbox and use it for more than just snapping off bolts and reattaching plating.
[P]Using a Breaker adds an automatic [AD] to Mechanics checks. When used as a weapon, a Breaker heavy hydrospanner has the following profile: Melee; Damage +2; Critical 4; Range (Engaged); Cumbersome 3, Disorient 1, Inaccurate 1.</Description>

[P]These droids are overall quietly competent, going about the business of following orders and carrying out construction plans with little fuss. Those that have developed personalities, such as the ones that serve with Alliance engineering units in the field, enjoy working with organics. On a job site, they are quiet and focused, but off the clock they tend to be garrulous and occasionally didactic.</Description>

RH-series research droids are a small-run series of science droids produced by Cybot Galactica. A variant of the company's 2R-series medical droid, they were designed to act as a combination research assistant and walking database for field scientists on research missions. Only a few thousand of these droids were produced, as they proved unpopular in the scientific community. Most of those produced are still active, though. They are commonly found working in farflung laboratories carrying out experiments that are too dangerous for organics or assisting in the same. Occasionally, they can even be found leading biological, anthropological, or archaeological field research.
[P]RH-series droids stand just shy of two meters tall, with a basic humanoid chassis covered in thick, protective plasteel plates. Their hands are packed with various manipulators, tools, probes, lights, and other small devices that allow the droids to carry out numerous scientific and research functions. They have a flat, oval-shaped head dominated by a single curving sensor window that resembles a helmet visor. RH-series droids are relatively agile and surefooted for droids, and they require little maintenance to keep running.
[P]These droids have a reputation for reliability-both mechanical and personal-while working in the field. They are detail oriented, are often work-obsessed, and can be fussy or develop various compulsive behaviors if they go too long between memory wipes. Alliance R&amp;D makes use of many RH-series droids, as do many freelance scientists and scholars the Alliance employs to discover new planets and make contact with new species.</Description>

Acids are dangerous, if imprecise, weapons. Although there are plenty of industrial and commercial acids on the open market, an alchemical acid is unique because it only affects living tissue. This means it can be applied to weapons, or even added to food.
[P]When affected by this potion, the target must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b]. If they fail, they suffer 2 wounds at the beginning of their turn for the next three rounds, plus one additional round per [TH].

    <Description>[H3]Training Weights[h3]
Many Warriors wear weighted bracers or anklets when training. This added weight and resistance not only helps the Warrior to build muscle, but also better prepares them to fight in difficult circumstances such as high-gravity environments. High-end models may incorporate an onboard computer that tracks the user's activity and even sets fitness goals. Some Warriors wear training weights in decidedly real-and potentially lethal-combat situations, although this contradicts all manufacturer specifications.
[P]A character wearing one or more training weights adds [SE] to all Brawn- and Agility-based checks, and to all combat checks. If a character wears training weights throughout a game session, increase the amount of XP the character receives for the session by 1. At the GM's discretion, a character wearing training weights may not receive this additional XP if they did not make any checks affected by the weights during the session.
[P][B]Models Include:[b] TaggeCo TruFit System, Sidyne M2 Smart-trainer.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]ASP-19 Battle Droid[h3]
Industrial Automaton's ASP-19 was a popular sparring droid among Jedi during the waning years of the Republic. Developed from ASP-series labor droids, the ASP-19 is a surprisingly capable melee fighter equipped with a sophisticated combat computer that can be programmed to approximate different Jedi fighting styles. In addition, the difficulty of the ASP-19's training routines can be adjusted up or down to better match the abilities of the trainee. The Jedi Order used these droids for training Jedi of all levels, from the greenest Padawan to the most venerated Jedi Master, and they were ubiquitous at the order's various temples and training facilities. While they were relatively simpleminded and programmed with subroutines that prevented them from killing, ASP-19s were occasionally pressed into service to protect their temples.
[P]ASP-19s are tall, burly constructs with broad shoulders and long limbs. Standing just over two meters tall, they are deceptively quick and possess a raw strength born out of their labor droid roots. Unlike typical battle droids, the ASP- I9 is optimized for up-close, hand-to-hand combat instead of ranged fighting. To that end, they are equipped with a retractable vibroblade in one arm and a training lightsaber in the other. What little personality they have is limited to discussion of fighting forms and spouting platitudes about the dignity and honor of dueling. Since they were discontinued nearly four decades ago, ASP- 19s are extremely rare and are often destroyed on sight by Imperial personnel. Those that survive, like the scattered remnants of the Jedi Order they once served, remain hidden on backwater worlds or in long-lost Jedi temples.</Description>

SR-series droids are produced by TransTech Droidworks for use as scouts and forward observers. Based on TTD'S civilian S-series survey droid, the SR-series was designed primarily to assist artillery and close air support units by seeking out distant targets and relaying location and targeting data back to base.
[P]SRs are small, unassuming, non-humanoid droids with a dome-shaped body studded with photoreceptors and long-range targeting systems. The underside of the droid's body houses a small, high-output repulsorlift generator and four retractable manipulators for fine-detail work. Their bodies are coated with an optical camouflage system that allows them to blend in with their surroundings, and they have an encrypted, long-range comms suite that allows them to transmit voice and data quickly and securely to allies.
[P]When in the field scouting or observing targets, SR-series droids are almost completely silent. Once back at base, however, they tend to chatter away endlessly at anyone unlucky enough to be in earshot This is especially pronounced following an extended deployment.</Description>

Shockingly aggressive and quite dangerous in groups, these constructs are deployed in en masse to overwhelm a target by sheer force of numbers. Even a single Harrier is a dangerous opponent, as it is quick and remarkably heavily armed, with a custom repeating blaster. Harriers can also be used as training remotes, as they possess built-in training software and a stun blaster that is used in place of the more lethal repeating blaster.</Description>

Industrial Automaton's DTS-series dismantler droids are a common sight in the galaxy's ports and breaking yards. Dismantlers are big, surprisingly nimble droids roughly the size of a small starfighter or large airspeeder. They are shaped somewhat like a mushroom, with a large sensor-studded dome of a head perched on a thin cylindrical body. Four insect-like legs surround the base of the body, and two massive arms tipped with powerful crushing claws sprout from beneath the head. Designed to dismantle and recycle starships, these burly droids are equipped with a suite of destructive tools and weapons, backed with the strength to use them. To get around shipyards quickly, dismantlers are also equipped with a repulsorlift generator and numerous small thrusters that give them a surprising turn of speed.
[P]While they are intelligent, they are remarkable single-minded and rarely interact with organic sentient beings other than to take orders, report, and ask for clarifications. This gives them a reputation as slow-witted and dull, which makes individuals unfamiliar with these droids tend to underestimate them.</Description>

Seekers are small, repulsor-driven, Class II droids used throughout the galaxy as couriers, scouts, and occasionally assassins. The ID9 by Arakyd Industries is a perfect example of the type. These small, nimble droids look like miniature Viper probe droids. They are commonly used by the ISB and Inquisitorius in the course of their work rooting out rebels, traitors, and Jedi. Roughly the size of a large datapad, these droids have a flat, saucer-shaped body covered in light-absorbing polycarbonate. A single large red photoreceptor surrounded by four small sensor globes is mounted on the leading edge of the saucer, and the dorsal surface is studded with antennae and sensors. Five multi-jointed limbs-three long and two short-are mounted to the droid's ventral surface. Each of these limbs is equipped with a powerful grasping claw and a short-range energy weapon that allow the little droids to knock out organics and other droids with ease.
[P]ID9 droids are not the smartest droids in the Imperial arsenal, but they make up for it with tenacity and a kind of low cunning not often seen in droids of their class. With their nearly silent repulsorlift generator, light-absorbing coating, and stealthy programming, they are well suited for sneaking and spying. Since these droids are used primarily by ISB agents and other secretive assets, most resistance operatives don't even know they exist. Those who have encountered them view them with equal parts annoyance, respect, and fear, because while they themselves are easy to deal with, their masters usually are not.</Description>

The IG-RM series is one the the more common offshoots of Holowan Laboratories IG-series combat droids. Closely related to the IG-series assassin droids, IG-RM droids are tall, faceless, imposing constructs with broad shoulders, spindly arms, and a penchant for violence. Designed to act as bodyguards and security personnel, IG-RM droids have a heavily armored torso and programming that makes them fanatically loyal to their owners. These droids have no qualms against harming other sentients at their owners' behest, and will even throw themselves directly into harm's way to protect their masters. They tend to take orders literally and show little in the way of initiative or creative thinking. Thanks to these traits and their looming, intimidating presence, many of these droids have found their way into the employ of various crime syndicates and corrupt governments as enforcers and toughs.
[P]IG-RM droids possess no internal weaponry. They are, however, programmed to handle most known military and civilian arms. They are also programmed for close-in melee combat and grappling, which comes in handy when an opponent needs to be subdued rather than killed outright.</Description>

Arakyd Industries' KX-series enforcer droids are a rarity in the Empire's armed forces. While droids in general are quite common in the Imperial military, those programmed for combat or other warlike functions are largely unheard of. General distrust of Class IV droids throughout the galaxy, plus the debacle of the dark trooper program, has soured the Joint Chiefs on the use of combat droids. One exception to this rule, however, is the Imperial Army's KX-series.
[P]Officially classified as security droids, KX-series droids are general-purpose units used in roles ranging from combat support to security to frontline battle. They stand just over two meters tall, with broad shoulders; long, thin limbs; and a skull-like head with two piercing white optical sensors. Their bodies are covered in dark gunmetal armor and an integrated back-mounted combat computer gives them an almost hunchbacked posture. Rigorously controlled and monitored, these droids are subjected to all appropriate service and maintenance, which gives them little opportunity to develop individual personalities. What little personality they do have is cool, commanding, and menacing. Extremely single-minded, they are quite difficult to bluff or distract from their given mission. Their humanoid form also means they can be equipped with almost any weapon a human could use.
[P]KX-series droids are a priority target for insurgents. Rebel leaderships put a bounty on their capture, and at least one cell has a KX among its membership that acts as an infiltrator and spy.</Description>

The ubiquitous MSE-series "mouse droids" are so common in the galaxy's starships and spaceports as to be nearly invisible. Designed by Rebaxan Columni decades before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, these tiny, boxy droids were produced by the billions. Closer in intellect and utility to a remote than to a full droid, they are equipped with a low-powered, single-function droid brain that can contain a single program at a time. These programs can be switched out with ease, making the droids surprisingly versatile. This versatility is hampered, however, by the droid's lack of intellect, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.
[P]Mouse droids are largely used in maintenance and custodial roles aboard ships and in military installations. With their three retractable manipulators and a surprisingly excellent sensor package, they excel at basic mechanical and electrical repair, and at cleaning, scraping, painting, and otherwise carry out the drudgery of keeping a starship ship-shape. They also make remarkably good security and communications droids, keeping watch over sensitive areas, carrying encrypted messages, or even acting as tools in espionage efforts.</Description>

These hovering, slablike devices are the latest attempts to thwart any would-be ship thieves. They are a recent Imperial invention, and can be found on most major planetary docking bays and shipyards as a response to growing resistance missions to acquire Imperial vessels. Once firmly clamped onto each leg of a ship’s landing gear, gravity locks use tractor beam technology to ensure a ship cannot take off. Their tough construction also means they are almost impossible to forcibly remove or even destroy without using weapons that will likely damage the ship itself.
[P]A single gravity lock costs 7,400 credits (rarity 6). It has a silhouette of 3 and encumbrance of 14, and counts as having a soak value of 15 and a wound threshold of 10. If attacked, [TH][TH] or [DE] may be spent to inflict half of the damage it suffers onto a ship to which it has been attached. Entering the unique key code created when the lock is installed is the usual manner to deactivate the device, but it can be dismantled in a laborious process requiring an upgraded [B]Formidable ([CH][CH][DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] and eight hours of hard work. If the character has direct knowledge of a gravity lock’s inner workings, they check is not upgraded and the process takes half the time.

Initially designed by the Vacutech Combine—which ran out of capital and declared bankruptcy during the development of this weapon thanks to Imperial meddling—the Vac Attack is a small projectile launcher worn around the wrist like a chrono. It fires bursts of small, extremely sharp discs that can shred armor and flesh like a flechette. The weapon's spread can be adjusted so that it fires all of its discs in a single line or in a broad arc that can catch multiple targets. Entirely silent and easily concealable, the Mk-127 is often used for jobs in which silence and stealth are paramount. 
[P]Changing the weapon's spread from single to arc requires a maneuver and grants the weapon the Blast 6 item quality. If Blast is activated, the weapon's supply of discs is exhausted in the shot. When worn on both wrists, Mk-127s can be fired as if they were a single weapon with a regular combat check, gaining the Linked 2 quality. Noticing that an individual is wearing one or a pair of these weapons requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b]. At the Game Master's discretion, the discs can be coated with various toxins. Reloads for the Mk-127 contain four discs and cost 100 credits.</Description>

Depending on the agent's species and constitution, death can take from 20 to 40 seconds.

    <Description>[H3]Cyanoxis D-570[h3]
Cyanoxis D-570 was originally developed by Toxico as an all-purpose rodenticide. An extremely aggressive anticoagulant, D-570 works by weakening the walls of a creature's small blood vessels. This causes them to rupture, leading to internal hemorrhaging and eventually death. Thanks to its particular and well-guarded chemical makeup, D-570 works on numerous species throughout the galaxy, a very rare quality in a vermin-killing poison. Spies and assassins began to capitalize on this shared toxicity not long after the poison first appeared on the market. 
[P]When used as an assassination tool, D-570 is typically administered through food and drink. Once ingested, the poison takes about a week to break down a sentient being's circulatory system and cause internal bleeding. During that time, the target is fatigued, bruises easily, and often bleeds slightly from the nose, mouth, or ears. Death typically results in ten days or fewer. Since death occurs so long after first exposure, it is often difficult to determine that D-570 was the cause of an individual's death. By the time a week has passed, there is little evidence left, and the assassin can be halfway across the galaxy and out of reach of punishment. 
[P]One dose of Cyanoxis D-570 requires a character to make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b] to overcome. On a failed check, the poison inflicts 2 wounds and 2 strain immediately, plus 1 wound and I strain per day for ten days or until the target succumbs to death. Each [TH] generated inflicts I additional strain per day as internal blood loss takes its toll on the target's constitution. [DE] can be spent to increase the number of days the poison stays in effect by one.

Originally produced for Corellian Security (CorSec) intelligence agents by Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals, Skirtopanol is a powerful truth serum used to coerce confessions out of suspects. Administered through injection, Skirtopanol typically takes effect in minutes. It makes the target lethargic, compliant, open to suggestion, and free with information. While under the influence of Skirtopanol, suspects tend to ramble, chase tangents, and trail off in the middle of sentences. Agents must work constantly to keep an interrogation on track when using Skirtopanol, but it typically is worth the effort. Interrogators must also closely monitor the amount of Skirtopanol injected, as an overdose can cause coma and permanent cognitive impairment. Courts frown on law enforcement agencies using Skirtopanol due to the suggestibility of individuals under its influence, and confessions extracted from subjects under its effects are often ruled as inadmissible.
[P]One dose of Skirtopanol requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b] to overcome. On a failed check, the drug inflicts 5 strain, and the difficulty of all checks the target makes to resist Charm or Coercion for the remainder of the encounter is upgraded once.

Vutalamine is a common anti-anxiety drug that Bio- Tech Industries produces and sells throughout the galaxy. Colloquially known as "vue," it has been a mainstay of the galactic pharmacopoeia for treating psychological maladies, muscle spasms, and seizures for at least a century. Vue has a calming effect that allows individuals to process information more clearly and make better decisions. It also slows down breathing and circulation, along with reducing tremors and steadying limbs. Thanks to these last qualities, many sharpshooters, slicers, and assassins use the drug to help steady their hands while shooting or to steady their nerves in extremely stressful situations. Long-term use of vue can be addicting, and side effects can include acute paranoia, suicidal ideation, and impairment of memory and judgment. 
[P]A single dose of vue lasts for twenty-four hours. During that time, the character upgrades the ability of any checks made to resist stress or fear once. In addition, the difficulty of Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) checks made at long or extreme range is reduced by one. At the Game Master's discretion, frequent use of vue can cause impaired judgment and loss of memory, imposing permanent [SE] on Intellect- and Cunning-based checks.</Description>

Cortex bombs are last-resort measures to keep an agent from breaking under interrogation.

A cybernetic disguise implant is composed of a series of systems embedded beneath an individual's skin. These systems allow their users to drastically change their appearance. An extremely invasive, and expensive, full-body implant, a cyber disguise includes a number of systems that can change a being's facial features, skin color, skin texture, hair length and color, eye color, and other surface physical traits. Perfect for infiltrators and deep-cover agents, a cyber disguise can help an agent blend into a crowd, take on a different identity, and even impersonate specific individuals, given enough study and preparation. 
[P]A cyber disguise gives a character all the advantages of a standard disguise kit. In addition, it grants users two ranks in the Indistinguishable talent. Changing general features—for example, changing eye color, altering hair color, or growing a beard—takes one to three rounds. More involved disguises can take minutes or hours to perfect. To take on the appearance of a specific individual, a cyber disguise user must make a thorough study of the subject, then make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Deception check[b] to set the disguise. A cyber disguise cannot change a being's general shape or size, add or subtract limbs, or allow an individual to impersonate a member of another species. At the Game Master's discretion, a cyber disguise could be used to impersonate species that are very similar to the user's; a human could impersonate a Chiss or Pantoran, for example.</Description>

Extremely small and unobtrusive, they are typically set into the back of a user's skull and hidden by hair or a flap of synthetic skin.
[P]They are highly secure, non-networked, and equipped with a stout anti-virus package. They cannot be sliced unless the user is incapacitated or the implant is removed. The user cannot access the information contained in the implant, so unless that person uploaded the data personally he typically does not know what information is within the item. Most agents who use this device prefer this arrangement as it helps ensure they cannot possibly divulge the secrets they carry.

    <Description>[H3]Holographic Image Disguiser[h3]
Also known as holoshrouds, holographic image disguisers (HIDs) use a small, self-contained holoprojector to create a holographic disguise for a single person or object. They project a high-resolution, prerendered image that completely covers a target. The holographic images are incredibly lifelike: they move, breathe, blink, twitch, etc. They are good enough to nearly always fool the unaided eye without a thorough inspection.
[P]HIDs are not perfect, however, and they are often not as useful as a regular or cybernetic disguise kit. Having an extremely low memory capacity, they can only store one prerendered image, which must be loaded in advance and cannot be changed on the fly. In addition, while an HID can fool a casual observer with ease, many droids, cameras, and other scanners can see through the disguise, thanks to the very faint flicker inherent in even the best hologram. They also consume an enormous amount of energy. Due to their small on-board energy cells, HIDs can only operate for a few minutes at a time unless they are plugged into an external power supply. They also do not emu- late vocal patterns, like the uniquely personalized holographic disguise matrix that the Snivvian bounty hunter/technician Sinrich designed during the Clone Wars. This means users must apply their own skills in verbal deception to complete a disguise. 
[P]A holographic disguise needs to be the same size as the target or larger. Detecting an HID with the naked eye requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b].

    <Description>[H3]Explosives Belt[h3]
A tool of Saboteurs and Infiltrators, the explosives belt is a small and convenient concealed demolitions kit. Produced in a wide variety of styles by various intelligence agencies throughout the galaxy, a typical explosives belt is a broad hide or synthetic belt with a sturdy buckle. Hidden within the belt strap is a length of detonite tape; a remote detonator cap and a length of wire are concealed in the buckle. Once placed, the detonator can be triggered by a comlink or a dedicated remote device. Explosives belts are typically used for sabotage, but they can also blast a door or hatch open for a quick escape in a pinch.
[P]Setting the explosive charge hidden in the belt requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. The charge detonates with the following profile: (Damage 15; Critical 3; Range (Engaged); Blast 5, Breach 1, Limited Ammo 1). Upgrade the difficulty of checks to detect the belt's true nature twice.</Description>

Kelvarek Consolidated Arms' RLR-331 is a Clone Wars-era weapon popular with mercenaries and insurgents throughout the galaxy. Remarkably similar in appearance to Baktoid Armor Workshop's E-5 blaster rifle-a fact that, during its heyday, did not go unnoticed by Baktoid's powerful legal department-the RLR-331 is a bulky weapon with a squat, squared-off barrel. It launches small guided rockets from a detachable magazine. Originally sold in bulk to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Bulldogs were carried by heavy-support B1 battle droids as anti-materiel and light anti-armor weapons. They were used to great effect against the Grand Army of the Republic's heavily armored clone troopers and fighting vehicles, and gained a fearsome reputation among the CIS's foes.

    <Description>[H3]Slicewire[h3]
Slicewire is a multipurpose cutting tool and makeshift weapon in common use among the galaxy's intelligence services. A standard-issue slicewire is a meter-long monofilament cable contained within a carbonite rod. With a twist, the rod splits in half and releases the monofilament, with the rod halves serving as handles. Thanks to the unique properties of monofilament, a slicewire can cut through nearly any material, from flesh and bone to duranium and plasteel. Also available on spools in lengths of up to one hundred meters, slicewire can be used to create deadly traps and snares and may be strung across corridors or alleys at neck height to catch pursuers unaware. Slicewire is typically only issued to the most experienced agents, as its use poses as much of a threat to the user as it does to the target. 
[P]Slicewire comes in small spools containing ten meters of wire. When used as a weapon, slicewire has the following profile: (Brawl; Damage +2; Critical 2; Range (Engaged); Pierce 2, Vicious 3). If a user fails a Brawl check when using this weapon, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to inflict the weapon's full damage onto the user.</Description>

Cybot Galactica's AC1 -series surveillance droids are among the most ubiquitous droids in the galaxy. Also known as "Spy Eyes," AC1-series droids are spherical droids just under a meter across, equipped with a low-output repulsorlift generator and packed full of sophisticated imaging and observation systems. Standard units carry a 360-degree holocam with a powerful holotransceiver designed to stream live footage to a remote operator's holodisplay. They also carry a multi-optic imaging package with passive low-light, thermal imaging, infrared, ultrasonic, digital optical, X-ray, and various other sensors. Further, they are equipped with a turret-mounted light blaster pistol for defensive and security purposes. 
[P]These droids are quite unintelligent and are programmed with little personality or initiative. A security officer who is in charge of patrol groups of AC1 droids usually pilots them remotely via a control board and voice commands. When left to their own devices, Spy Eyes patrol their given routes and make regular reports to their controller If an AC1 detects intruders, it alerts its controller and then follows the intruders at a distance, recording and observing their movements until a security team can arrive. The Imperial military makes heavy use of these droids, which can be found in nearly every base, camp, installation, and space station under Imperial control. Recently, Alliance intelligence agents discovered that, thanks to a previously unknown exploit in their programming, AC1 droids can be sliced into and taken control of remarkably easily.</Description>

    <Name>E522 Assassin Droid</Name>
    <Description>[H3]E522 Assassin Droid[h3]
The E522 is one of the most feared droids operating in the galaxy today. These burly, hard-hitting droids were originally designed during the buildup to the Clone Wars by Techno Union member corporation Baktoid Combat Automata (BCA). Initially part of BCA's successful B-series battle droid line, the E522 was envisioned as a light anti-armor and anti-aircraft unit that would provide heavy support to platoons of B1 and B2 units. They were seen as too expensive and complex to serve as disposable droid soldiers, however, and the project was scrapped in favor of the B2 and B3 battle droid units.
[P]When the Clone Wars finally ended with the destruction of both the Republic and the Separatists, the Techno Union dissolved, and its member corporations either struck out on their own or were brought under direct Imperial control. BCA was one of the companies nationalized by the Empire, and it was immediately slated for breakup. Through the process of BCA's breakup and the selling off of its various assets, all data from the E522 project fell into the hands of Sienar Intelligence Systems. SIS had been working on plans for its own line of combat and assassin droids, and the acquisition of the E522 R&amp;D data was a huge boon to its project. SIS quickly scrapped its in-house project and poured an immense amount of time and money into bringing the E522 project to fruition. Within a year, the first E522s rolled out of SIS's assembly line and straight into the growing unrest leading up to the Galactic Civil War.
[P]As much a front-line combat droid as an assassin unit, the E522 is a massive, hulking construct festooned with heavy weapons and covered in thick, military-grade armor. It has a rounded, diamond-shaped torso with no discernible head, an extremely narrow waist that rotates 360 degrees, and two heavy tank treads covered in armored skirts in place of legs. Two long, multi-jointed arms sprout from armored shoulders and are equipped with a heavy repeating blaster, heavy ion blaster, and rapid-fire needler gun in place of hands. Three smaller arms with highly dexterous hands are mounted low on the droid's torso to take care of fine work, and a mini-missile launcher is mounted to the droid's back. Scattered about the droid's body is an array of sensors, antennae, and photoreceptors that grant the E522 560-degree full-spectrum vision. The vision system, combined with a powerful on-board combat computer and targeting system, makes these droids a terror on the battlefield.
[P]There are currently fewer than one hundred E522 droids operating in the galaxy. Most of these are in active service with Imperial Army Intelligence and the Imperial Security Bureau as assassins and support units for various Imperial black ops. These droids, with their regular memory wipes and maintenance, retain the silent and intimidating personalities that their Sienar programmers gave them. A handful have fallen into the hands of the Alliance, mostly as battlefield salvage. They are serving the Alliance well in roles similar to those in which they served the Empire. E522s in the Alliance have developed gruff, demanding, cynical personalities that agents who work with them describe as "like everyone's least favorite Master Sergeant." Despite this, Alliance E522s are well liked and respected for their bravery and competence in the field.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]LSx-series Slicer Droid[h3]
One of the very few dedicated slicer droids on the market, the LSx-series packs an immense amount of computing power into a small package. A product of the notoriously corrupt and rapacious Loronar Corporation, the I-SX was introduced during the early years of the Galactic Empire as a "programming and computer sciences" droid, marketed toward educational institutions and technology companies. Loronar being Loronar, however, the droid was in fact a dedicated slicer unit geared toward industrial espionage and military intelligence. Along with the aboveboard marketing, Loronar used all of its corporate might to peddle these droids to any law enforcement or government intelligence agency that would take them, including the Empire and various factions within the Rebel Alliance. While the ISB and Imperial military Intelligence agencies demurred, having already signed contracts with Arakyd and MerenData to purchase espionage and slicer droids, the Alliance snapped LSx droids up in bulk to bolster its small intelligence corps.
[P]LSx-series droids are humanoid-shaped constructs just under two meters tall, with spindly limbs and a long, animal-like head reminiscent of Baktoid's old B1 battle droids. They are equipped with cutting-edge slicer gear and powerful programming and data analysis firmware easily rivaling that of most intelligence agencies and criminal organizations. Packed into their hands and bulky forearms is an array of fine manipulators, computer probes, scomp links, circuit chasers, and other electronics and computer repair tools that allow the droids to access anything from a datapad to a military-grade mainframe. Mounted between the knuckles of their right hand, they even carry a scomp-spiker, a highly illegal piece of industrial espionage and sabotage equipment that pours a devastating high-voltage charge through a computer system to destroy both hardware and software. Although they are not programmed for combat, LSx-series droids can defend themselves if necessary, and the scomp-spiker makes for an extremely nasty weapon against both organics and droids. 
[P]These droids rarely speak, and when they do it is in a nearly indecipherable patois of technical jargon, acronyms, and academic pedantry. However, LSx-series droids that have gone without regular maintenance and memory wipes often learn to express themselves in ways less likely to bore and drive away colleagues. Some develop obsessive and deeply sarcastic personalities. The Rebel Alliance currently uses the majority of LSx-series droids that have been produced, typically assigning them to base duty where they work endless hours attempting to crack Imperial military network security.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]M4-series Messenger Droid[h3]
Another of Cybot Galactica's popular and well-liked entries into the droid market, the M4-series is perhaps the finest messenger droid currently available. M4-series droids are roughly half a meter tall and have a thin, blocky, pentagonal body with no external limbs and a small, highly secure compartment built into the right side. A large holoprojector lens dominates the front face of the droid, and a small, high-output repulsorlift generator provides propulsion and gives the M4 a surprising burst of speed when needed. As dedicated messenger droids, M4s are equipped with a high-resolution holoprojector and an on-board memory that can store a single message up to five minutes long. M4s also carry a long-range comlink and a sophisticated navigation suite that connects to the HoloNet for real-time travel and navigation information nearly anywhere in the galaxy. 
[P]Relatively bright and remarkably clever, M4-series droids were built with one goal in mind: to deliver their message at any cost. To that end, these droids are overbuilt to an almost ridiculous degree. They are packed full of redundant operating systems and triple-secure encryption for their messages. Their bodies are heavily reinforced and fitted with solid armor that can turn shots from light-caliber slugthrowers and low-powered blasters with ease. Their shape and size allow them to squeeze through tiny spaces, and a patented Cybot Galactica stealth subroutine allows these little droids to flit about largely unnoticed when needed. Thanks to their design, sturdy build, and on-board systems, M4-series droids have developed a reputation for successfully delivering their messages no matter how hard the trip, how long it takes, or how much damage they suffer en route.
[P]M4s are rare in Imperial service, as the ISB and other intelligence agencies have their own, bespoke messenger droids in the shape of the familiar MSE-series and AS-MI 2-series droids. A fair number of these sturdy droids have found their way into the Alliance, where they work with intelligence and courier services to run encrypted messages between various Rebel cells. Many M4 droids in Alliance employ take immense pleasure in breaking through various levels of Imperial security to deliver their data. One such droid is even rumored to have broken into an Imperial stockade somewhere in the Outer Rim to deliver a message—and a holdout blaster—to an imprisoned Alliance intelligence agent.</Description>

    <Name>Q-Signal Messenger Droid</Name>
    <Description>[H3]Q-Signal Messenger Droid[h3]
The Q-Signal Messenger Drone from Incom is unlike anything on the market today. Essentially a stripped-down starfighter piloted by a savant-level droid brain, the a-Signal drone is designed to deliver encrypted data and physical specimens through hyperspace to predetermined coordinates. Little more than a space-going dead drop facilitator, the single-minded droid brain that controls the vehicle knows nothing more than its current whereabouts and whatever hyperspace coordinates are programmed into its limited-memory navicomputer. Both Imperial and Alliance intelligence agencies use Q-Signal drones in large numbers. They are commonly found aboard patrol and picket ships, but most military starships carry one or two aboard. 
[P]To use a Q-Signal drone, an agent simply loads data or cargo aboard the vessel and feeds hyperspace coordinates into the navicomputer. The Q-Signal is then pushed out of a hangar bay or launched from a fighter catapult into space, where it jumps away to make its delivery. When a Q-Signal arrives at its destination, it falls into a low-power mode to wait for pickup. While powered down, the droid keeps itself on station with automated thrusters and a simple passive sensor system. Once it is retrieved and its data or cargo removed, its memory is wiped and it is either put in storage aboard the receiving vessel to await another run or returned to its sender.</Description>

    <Name>RA-7 Protocol Droid</Name>
    <Description>[H3]RA-7 Protocol Droid[h3]
The RA-7 series is the Galactic Empire's go-to choice for protocol and espionage droids. Arakyd Industries designed and produced this series in the years leading up to the Clone Wars in an ambitious but ultimately failed attempt to compete with Cybot Galactica's ubiquitous 3PO-series protocol droids. RA-7s are gawky, awkward-looking droids just under two meters tall, with spindly limbs, a head reminiscent of a Verpine's, and huge, bulbous photoreceptors that take up the majority of their face. Their personalities are, on the whole, dull and dry with an air of aloofness that few owners find tolerable. RA-7s that have gone without regular maintenance and memory wipes tend to be morose, pessimistic, and constantly exasperated with everyone and everything around them.
[P]The RA-7 line's great failure, which ended Arakyd's plans for further expansion in the protocol droid market, is the fact that the droids offer nothing unique to their buyers. Their etiquette and protocol programming is respect- able, and their ability to analyze and collate data is actually quite remark- able, but there is nothing they do that Cybot Galactica's 5POs can't do cheaper, better, and more reliably. After years of dwindling sales and tens of thousands of unsold units, Arakyd canceled the line and offered its entire back stock to the Imperial armed forces at fire-sale prices. Only the ISB took Arakyd up on its offer, and only then, through modification and reprogramming, did the RA-1s find purpose.
[P]The ISB thoroughly overhauled the thousands of RA-7s it purchased, installing new programming and upgrading the droids' sensor package. Each droid received a sophisticated intelligence-gathering system that included active and passive listening devices and multi-optic, high-resolution photoreceptors with numerous vision modes and the ability to record and transmit audio, video, and holographic data. A constant-on uplink to the ISB's secure HoloNet was installed to give RA-7s constant access to the ISB's expansive databases and to ensure the droids can upload the information they collect as they go about their business. All of these systems are cleverly hidden in plain sight throughout the droid's chassis, and the espionage programming looks like innocent etiquette and protocol subroutines when examined.
[P]Once they were modified, the ISB deployed their RA-7 droids throughout the Imperial armed forces to keep tabs on Imperial personnel and root out criminals and traitors. Nearly all RA-7s currently active are in Imperial service. Very few have defected to or been stolen by the Alliance; those that have are considered to be nearly priceless thanks to their espionage and intelligence-gathering equipment and their knowledge of ISB protocols. Some models found other roles to play in the Rebellion. One RA-7, for example, escaped ISB reprogramming and served as an inventory specialist in one of the more infamous Rebel cells.</Description>

    <Name>RM-series Military Intelligence Droid</Name>
    <Description>[H3]RM-series Military Intelligence Droid[h3]
The RM-series is a powerful, highly competent espionage droid from the powerful security firm MerenData. Until recently, MerenData was known for its line of espionage droids based on Cybot Galactica's 5PO protocol droids. The release of the RM-series was MerenData's first attempt at a droid designed in-house, and so far that attempt has been a rousing success. Only recently introduced after years of research and development, RMS are small, squat, kite-shaped droids about a meter tall, with an armored, flat-topped head. Their burly arms are tipped with heavy weapons, and numerous dexterous manipulators for grasping and fine-motor work hang from their flat undercarriages. These droids move about via a baffled repulsorlift engine that makes little noise and produce almost no energy signature or emissions. Their personalities are laconic and no-nonsense, although those droids that go without their regular maintenance and memory wipes develop strange philosophical or artistic streaks. 
[P]RM-series droids specialize in military intelligence, specifically post-battle analytics and the study of enemy tactics and strategy. They are commonly dispatched to war zones to gather battlefield data and to observe how clashing forces fight in various galactic conditions. As this is an exceedingly dangerous task, these droids are well armored and carry an array of heavy anti-personnel and anti-droid weaponry. They are equipped with a sophisticated suite of intelligence-gathering and data analysis systems and come packed with optical, audio, chemical, energy, and other sensors. RMS also possess respectable engineering and infiltration programming that allows them to act as combat engineers and saboteurs when needed. Many Imperial camps have been flattened by an RM-series droid's homemade explosives and cunning trickery. 
[P]In Alliance and Imperial espionage circles, RM-series droids have gained a reputation as highly competent units that can be relied upon in the field. This is more so in the Alliance, where these droids are often part of infiltration and sabotage teams, in which their knowledge and offensive capabilities can be used to their fullest potential.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]TS-series Interrogation Droid[h3]
The construction and use of interrogation droids is looked down upon in the more civilized areas of the galaxy. That being said, the widespread ethical concerns surrounding these frightening droids has never stopped droid manufacturers from building them, nor has it stopped government agencies and criminal enterprises from purchasing as many as they can. For the main branches of Imperial Military Intelligence, Arakyd Industries has been the provider of choice for droids. The notorious and frightening IT-O series started out as an Arakyd design before being retooled by the Department of Military Research, and Arakyd's Viper probe droid is also a common Imperial Navy standby. Arakyd's new TS-series interrogation droids are the latest addition to the Empire's roster.
[P]Marketed as "medical droids," TS-series droids are small, inhuman-looking constructs just over two meters tall. They have a thin, flat, curving torso similar to a droideka's and two long, spindly arms equipped with a frightening array of blades, injectors, cutting lasers, and other vicious-looking medical apparatus. Their flat, cowled head sports four bright-red photoreceptors all in a horizontal line. The base of their body is a flattened triangle that acts as a counter-weight and the hub of a low-profile, solid rubber wheel used for locomotion. While they can talk, and are often effusive when reporting information or discussing interrogation techniques with their handlers or other droids, TS-series interrogators are relatively quiet when performing actual interrogations. They tend to ask simple, uncomplicated questions in a straightforward and often cheerful manner, apply pain as needed, and repeat the sequence until they get the information they require. 
[P]Very few of these ghastly droids exist currently, and all of them are in service with the Imperial Military Intelligence services. Word of their introduction has recently begun circulating throughout the Alliance, primarily from Rebel moles within the ISB. The rumors of the TS-series' capabilities grow more and more outrageous with every telling, and there is currently a large reward for any Rebel cell that can capture one and return it intact for study.</Description>

      [H3]Dataspike[h3]
Dataspikes, also known as slicers' spikes or computer spikes, are a common tool for bypassing computer security. While expert Slicers sometimes craft advanced examples to break into particular systems, a typical dataspike can be put together to work with any computer. Once installed in a system, a dataspike releases a barrage of junk data that overwhelms security, allowing the user a window in which  to access the secured systems. Dataspikes are typically designed to burn out after use, leaving behind minimal evidence.
[P]Once per round, a character with a dataspike may expend it to attempt to disable a security program as a maneuver (rather than as an action). This can include the use of the Disable Security Program action (see [B]Slicing Encounters,[b]). Reduce the difficulty of the subsequent Computers check to disable the program by 2, to a minimum of [B]Simple (-)[b]. After one use, the dataspike burns out and becomes useless.

     Some facilities require discretion and art as much as they do security. Stone guardian droids are specifically designed for these situations. They provide a potent defense that is utterly in keeping with the overall tone of a site.[P]
Despite the name, stone guardians are not actually constructed out of stone. Their armored shells are simply sculpted and painted to resemble some form of rock or marble. When inactive, stone guardians appear to be decorative statues. The statues might be freestanding, or they could appear to be a support pillar or a part of a wall. Only when they activate does their true nature become clear. A stone guardian's passive detectors are extremely sensitive and rigged to detect any intruders who enter its domain. When they identify a threat, the droids activate and attempt to eliminate it.

First attributed to the precursors of the Jedi, these objects remain a mystery. At the surface level, Dai Bendu holocrons resemble those produced by the Jedi. Each holocron contains six tracts, subdivided into four lessons apiece. Unlike ones made by the Jedi, Dai Bendu holocrons allow even the most unskilled of Force sensitives access. Their true key to mastery lies in study.
[P]Completing each lesson in the tract requires an amount of study and meditation up to the GM's decision. At its conclusion, the player must roll a Discipline check of one higher difficulty than it took to access that lesson. For example, to complete the first lesson, a Mystic must roll an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Discipline check[b]. To complete the final lesson in a tract requires a [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b].
[P]When a Force-sensitive character completes a tract, the player selects one characteristic. Once per day, they may upgrade the ability dice pool of any single check related to that characteristic by two steps. The player has learned all they can from that tract, and must move on to another. Each subsequent tract provides the same benefit to another characteristic.
      [P][I]Note:  Select which tracts have been learned using the built-in attachment.  Each tract is an optional modification.[i]

    [H3]Lasan Chronicles of the Three[h3]
Life since the fall of the Republic has grown difficult for the Lasat. The Empire exterminated them in droves, a gruesome example to those who seek to rebel. Many Lasat now search for meaning in an existence that seems to only want them destroyed. Many turn to their species' most ancient teachings in hopes of finding some parallels, some guidance for a people adrift. One of the most frequent resources for this study has been the Chronicles of the Three. This collection of ancient parables follows the three Lasan mythic archetypes: the Child, the Fool, and the Warrior.
[P]When a character studies the Chronicles, they may use Perception, Knowledge (Lore), or Discipline to decipher it. They must then spend an hour studying the Chronicles, succeeding at a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) check[b]  of the appropriate skill at the end of it. Depending on their chosen skill. they receive a unique bonus that can be used once during the remainder of the session. Knowledge (Lore) grants the Perspicacity of the Child , whose desire to learn outstrips all else. The character may add [BO] to any one Knowledge skill check they make. Perception gives them the Insight of the Fool: in knowing nothing, they see everything. Once, when making a combat skill check, they may re-roll one [AB] of their choice. Using Discipline leaves them with the Purpose of the Warrior, whose devotion and tenacity overcomes all obstacles. They may remove [SE] on a single skill check that they make.
      [P][I]Note:  Select lessons studied for this session using the built-in attachment.  Each lesson is an optional modification.[i]

Wars between the dark side and the light are not only fought in an individual's conscience. Centuries ago, the Sith Order formed the backbone of a terrifying war machine. One of their most fearsome strongholds resided on the Outer Rim planet of Malachor. Rumors spread that the Sith bastion hid unstoppable weaponry and forbidden knowledge. Fearing the worst, the Jedi laid siege to the temple.
[P]The battle left no survivors. The Jedi archives erased all records of the planet, hoping to bury the Sith secrets along with the dead. Over time, spacers began to claim they had stumbled on the lost world of Malachor. They'd bring back artifacts claimed to be Sith relics. Most were obvious frauds. A few had a genuine-and disquieting-connection to the dark side.
[P]Smugglers claimed to make Ashes of Malachor from the pulverized bones left on the planet. With the planet lost to the galaxy at large, there is no way to confirm this. The results, though, are irrefutable. Some dark essence trapped within the ashes empowers those that consume it. Gruesome power warps their will, increasing their power at the cost of their Morality.
[P]A Force-sensitive character may spend a maneuver to inhale the Ashes of Malachor. They gain 5 Conflict, but add [SU][TH] to all attacks they make until the end of the encounter.</Description>

Life on Sembla owes a great deal to the planet's many active volcanoes. The intense geothermal energy of the planet warms the world's shallow seas. The seas, in turn, host a cavalcade of life. Lava flows bring minerals and materials to the surface. While they never developed heavy industry, the Vurk are famous for their craftsmanship. The vast majority of art produced on Sembla depicts the volcanoes. At times, this reverence has bordered on religious devotion.
[P]One of the oldest tokens of this reverence is the Vurk Meditation
Orb. The orbs are perfect obsidian spheres, roughly 15 centimeters across. Part of the consecration process involves polishing the surface to a mirror sheen. Even though the Vurk invest a lot of time into crafting them, they do not consider them manufactured. From the traditional standpoint, they are not made so much as found. Any spherical chunk of obsidian can serve the orb's function. While the most sacred orbs are perfectly black, sages tolerate-even prefer-the presence of impurities within the glass.
[P]Studying the opaque sphere allows a Mystic to focus inwards, leaving the world behind. In this state, they see only the connections between beings, hear only the whispers of the Force. This meditation lasts for at least an hour, and for the 24 hours following this meditation, they may suffer 2 strain to add [FP] to the results of the next check to use the Alter or Battle Meditation Force power.</Description>
