    <Description>[H4]A Higher Calling[h4]
Even in the rough-and-tumble world of [B]Edge of the Empire[b], there are those who strive to change the galaxy - often for the better, but sometimes for the worse. Perhaps the character has made a vow to help others, which works nicely into the Oath Obligation. A character may receive some sort of sign that tells him to leave behind his former life and make his way to the fringes of the galaxy to serve this higher calling.</Description>

Some inherent flaw in the character causes him to leave behind the life he knew for the unknown. This background hook ties in well with some Obligations such as Addiction, Obsession, or Betrayal. Regardless of the cause, the character finds himself shut out from his former society, left to deal with his own problems. However, the character may view this in a positive light, seeing himself freed from the pressures of scrutiny or keeping on the move to leave trouble behind.</Description>

      [H4]The New Recruit[h4]

Under the guidance of such wise administrators as Mon Mothma, the Alliance began recruiting efforts very early in its inception. Those skilled in the ways of intelligence, oration, and sheer talent scouting were employed from the start to build growing networks dedicated to finding those who had cause to oppose the Empire as well as the capability and the will to take action against it. As the conflict grows, so, too, does this network dedicated to finding bodies to fill the ranks and serve the needs of the Alliance. 

[P]A Player Character may well be a part of the Rebellion because he was discovered by someone in this network—someone who saw his potential and recognized his willingness to fight against the current regime imposed by Emperor Palpatine. It might not even have been someone normally tasked with recruitment who found the PC; chance encounters by those connected to the Alliance with those who might be able to help occur all the time, and risks are frequently taken if it means an opportunity to gain the services of a capable and savvy ally. 

[P]The cellular nature of most Alliance operations minimizes the risk of betrayal fairly well. Such recruits are tested considerably before they are ever given access to sensitive material or plans, and their awareness of the extent of the network they are connected to is kept to a minimum until they have truly earned the trust of their superiors.</Description>

      [H4]The Searching Insurgent[h4]

Once they make the decision to oppose the terror and atrocities of the Empire, many individuals go looking for a way to contact and join up with the Rebellion. As badly as the Alliance needs people, though, it's not necessarily easy to find Alliance members to talk to about signing on. The vastly superior forces and assets of the Empire make it very dangerous for anyone to openly support the Alliance, as many planets and people discovered in the immediate aftermath of the Declaration of Rebellion. Imperial Intelligence and related agencies—not to mention countless bounty hunters—are constantly searching for any and all beings connected to the Rebellion, so secrecy is paramount to survival. 

[p]As such, finding a way to join the Alliance's efforts against the Empire can be a quest all its own. It could even be the basis for the start of an [B]Age of Rebellion[b] campaign. Hopefuls need to do a lot of research, investigation, and sneaking around to discover clues about the Rebellion and to avoid the attention of Imperial agents. At the same time, they must prove themselves capable and trustworthy to anyone with whom they might make contact. Such an endeavor is a very tense, very delicate game of cat and mouse at first; the searchers might even fall under Alliance observation for a time, not knowing they are being observed and judged while they continue to try to find a way in. 

[P]Many who want to join the Rebellion do so in rather dramatic fashion, taking it upon themselves to simply start striking against Imperial forces and assets. Such acts can be foolhardy and stupid, but they can also be brave and daring. If the would-be Rebels manage to succeed without getting themselves killed in the process, they may well draw the attention of Alliance operatives who are willing to talk to them about joining.</Description>

      [H4]The Accidental Rebel[h4]

The vast majority of the sentient beings of the galaxy have no desire to join the Alliance or serve in the Rebellion. They may not be ardent supporters of the Empire, but this doesn't mean they are willing to drop everything in their lives to go blasting away at hordes of stormtroopers or weaving a dilapidated starship through swarms of TIE fighters. They would rather go about their business and live their lives, hopefully out of the way of any battles or other trouble. 
[P]Unfortunately for some hapless individuals, the galaxy has other plans. Cases of mistaken identity can result in innocents becoming wanted for crimes they never even considered. Receiving goods marked for Alliance use may find one or more PCs fleeing for their lives from Imperial agents or hired mercenaries. A friend's—or even casual acquaintance's—involvement with the Rebellion can saddle a character with unintended guilt by association. Of course, there are times when people simply find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time and have no choice but to become heroes. 

[P]Alternately, unexpected situations may cause an epiphany for someone who was previously not interested in getting involved. While it may be easy to ignore tales of injustice and atrocity when they happen far away from an individual's daily life, many individuals have altogether different reactions when they come face-to-face with the horror of the Empire's policies. Apathy is difficult to maintain when someone watches another sentient executed for speaking out, a family enslaved because of their species, or an entire population wiped out for political expediency. 

[P]In such situations, a person's apathy can quickly turn to anger. That anger, in turn, often turns to action, usually with violent and irrevocable consequences. Once steps are taken toward open and direct opposition, such a character has joined the Rebellion in spirit, even if not yet in fact.</Description>

      [H4]Dissident Artist[h4]

Some people have a creative drive that cannot be stilled, and craft works that not only give expression to their thoughts and emotions but also push others to question their own positions. The PC has always been an uncompromising artist, and his controversial works eventually drew the ire of the Empire. In the face of pressure to tone down his creations, the PC refused to compromise his art and redoubled his efforts, challenging the establishment and inspiring the resistance. He became wanted as a political dissident of the Empire, but is now a welcome asset to the Alliance. 

[P]The value of an artist should not be underestimated. The character might possess an uncanny insight into how people of all species think, or he might have honed his skills and ingenuity through countless crafts and creations. Further, many artists have a level of celebrity that gives them unique access to people and places across the galaxy.</Description>

      [H4]Imperial Outcast[h4]

For obedient citizens of the Empire, success is said to come from joining the forces of law and order. Whether through Officer School, or as a bureaucrat in one of many local puppet governments, or merely as a low-level desk jockey, people from all worlds are encouraged to contribute to their government and reap the rewards of status and power. The PC started down this road, but events conspired to change his path. Perhaps the character became disillusioned with the chain of authority after being given an unsavory order, or he became a victim of the corruption and discrimination rampant within the Empire. 

[P]Forgetting the mindset that comes from years of training in the Empire is no simple task, and the character is likely to feel isolated, like a traitor who abandoned everything he had. However, he is likely to find, amid the ranks of the Rebel Alliance, others who began as the Empire's brightest and eventually realized that they, too, had to leave. </Description>

      [H4]Minority Voice[h4]

The Empire has built much of its power by taking advantage of conflict, ostracizing and exploiting smaller populations for its own gain. Some species, such as the Wookiees, are enslaved on their own worlds. Others are merely denied the privileges of the common citizen. Rather than choose to accept this injustice silently, the PC spoke up for a group victimized by the Empire's abuses. As a champion who fights for fairness for these outcasts, the PC highlights the injustices brought upon them. The Empire does not tolerate dissent, but the Rebel Alliance welcomes such voices. 

[P]The minority voice is likely to be an outspoken member of the Alliance. With a specific cause to champion, the character has good reason to push the group to do more to help those in need.</Description>

The galaxy is home to a dazzling array of shipyards, factories, and industrial complexes manufacturing all manner of equipment, such as weapons, droids, capital ships, mundane tools, and luxury items. The PC comes from a life of work in such operations, perhaps employed as a labor captain, shift supervisor, bureaucrat, or possibly even as the partial or sole owner of such a corporation. Running an operation that makes and distributes complicated equipment is no easy task, but the PC has made a career of making sure everyone in the business operates in unison to get things built. An astute knowledge of resource management can prove a boon to the beleaguered Alliance. 

[P]Unfortunately, many of the challenges facing the Alliance come to rest at the industrialist's doorstep. The Rebel forces are disparate, poorly funded, and frequently constrained to operating in secret. In sec-tors where the Empire's control is tight and regulations are strict, the character must reach into the depths of his experience to make ends meet.</Description>

Between races, competitors often participate in exhibitions to hone their skills, test their vehicles, and dazzle spectators with heart-stopping maneuvers. 

[P]Most competition pilots are peaceful, living only for the thrill of victory, and for feeling that unique bond with their vehicle that only comes from pushing it to the limit with daredevil stunts and holo finishes. However, if pushed into choosing a side in the Galactic Civil War, entertainers possess the precise control over their vehicles required to make them lethal combatants. </Description>

      [H4]Clone Wars Veteran[h4]

While many think of the Clone Wars as a conflict between Jedi-led clone armies and Separatist droids, the truth of the matter is that most combatants were part of local defense forces and resistance movements. Veterans of the Clone Wars are valued as instructors first, who pass on their valuable combat experience to bush pilots and freighter captains joining the fight. Still, when called upon to suit up, veterans are able to shake any rust quickly, and become lethal presences in any skirmish. 

[p]The Clone Wars gave many Aces the chance to establish heroic legacies, which thrust them into prominent military or political roles in the subsequent Galactic Empire. Others quietly retired, any lust for combat they might have once possessed satisfied ten-fold. On the other hand, most Separatist veterans languished in exile on the Outer Rim or rotted in Imperial prisons. When the Rebellion against the Empire took shape, a number of veteran Aces defected from the Empire, came out of retirement, or were freed by the Rebels to assist in their struggle. 

[P]The list of Clone Wars veterans among Rebel ranks is extensive, including Garven Dreis, immortalized for his sacrifice at the Battle of Yavin under the call sign Red Leader. During the Clone Wars, Dreis was a local defense force pilot at Virujansi, and flew alongside Anakin Skywalker.</Description>

      [H4]Imperial Defector[h4]

Imperial academies at Carida, Raithal, Corulag, and Prefsbelt turn out a never-ending stream of officers, stormtroopers, and pilots for the Empire. The academy teaches standard Imperial tactics and maneuvers, so that graduates can assimilate into military units throughout Imperial space. The program weans out undesirables by design, and a fair percentage of each class of trainees washes out. 
[P]While the curriculum emphasizes loyalty to the Empire, many cadets find themselves unable to execute what they see as unjust orders. These graduates often desert or defect to the Rebellion. A famous example is the mutiny of the Rand Ecliptic, which was led by recent academy graduates Biggs Darklighter and Derek "Hobbie" Klivian. Once in command of the vessel, Biggs, Hobbie, and a number of other sympathetic TIE pilots joined up with the Rebellion.</Description>

Most agriworlds in the galaxy are the same: vast fields used to grow crops or graze herds, with long distances between neighbors. The farmers and ranchers of the galaxy typically use airspeeders as utility vehicles for crop dusting, herding, and transport into town. The bored youth of most quiet agriworlds almost universally chase adventure by buzzing the fields and threading the canyons of their homeworlds, imagining they are anywhere else in the galaxy. These young bush pilots often meet up and race through dangerous terrain unsupervised, and are among the most underrated pilots in the galaxy thanks to their extremely informal training. 

[P]Perhaps the most famous bush pilot in the galaxy is Luke Skywalker, who honed his skills flying a T-16 Skyhopper across Tatooine's Beggar's Canyon and moisture farms with his friends. Skywalker went on to become the hero of the Battle of Yavin and a key leader in the elite Rogue Squadron. Countless pilots of the Rebellion come From similar, humble origins, and sometimes their lack of formal training enables them to surprise opponents trained in traditional combat tactics. </Description>

A wayfaring Guardian rises to the occasion, but neither allies nor accolades can keep this character rooted. After all, hyperspace is calling just as surely as the voices of the weak, the powerless, and the oppressed.
[P]Indeed, perhaps the need to protect others keeps this Guardian traveling - lingering too long in one place risks drawing the wrath of the Empire upon the very people the Guardian sought to safeguard. Guardians of this sort often follow only the call of their own conscience, unbound by structured regulations or explicit codes. Still, there are always exceptions; some who wander do so to fulfill oaths, uphold obligations, or pursue more esoteric ends.[P][H4]

The galaxy is unfathomably ancient, and over countless millennia, thousands of species have lived and discovered new ways to transform their environments to their needs. At first glance, manufacturing techniques used only in a single community on a backwater world might seem less advanced than those used in a vast starship construction facility. However, these unique methods may produce results that are not directly comparable, or may even perform certain tasks better than their "modern" counterparts. The metallurgy of some societies whose members have never left their homeworlds have been found to surpass the industrial standards used to fabricate starship hulls due to the specialized techniques used by these enclaves. Other cultures have found inventive solutions to problems the wider galaxy never even thought to address, from creative energy solutions in absence of traditional fuels, to esoteric weapons that function on principles that still evade even the sharpest researchers and academics.

secondhand. Brave recruiters carefully spread propaganda vids across backwater planets and arrange
meetings to discuss how the Empire impacts the galaxy, eventually swaying local youth to join the Alliance.
Most rimfolk already possess most of the skills the rebels want in their recruits. Life on the Rim often teaches
them resilience in the face of adversity, familiarity with
ranged weaponry, basic equipment repair skills, and an
eagerness for any life that gets them offworld.</Description>

Refugees have escaped violence, starvation, and persecution only to face similar problems in their new home. In some cases, cities are unprepared to handle an influx of refugees and have no social services set up to accommodate them. In extreme instances, governments separate refugees from the rest of the population and cut them off from economic opportunities. On other worlds, differences in culture create tensions among the populations, and refugees face violence from the citizenry rather than the government.</Description>

      [H4]The Local Leader[h4]
     Many colonies, especially the smaller ones, contain a core cadre of prominent individuals. These business-people, ranchers, professionals, and other citizens in good standing have a strong influence on a local community. A small colony might lack an established political system or authoritative central government. Instead, these local leaders step in to fill the void, doing what they can to keep their community running smoothly.

     Founding a colony is hard work, but a generation or two later, when the hardest work is done but opportunity still abounds, the opportunist moves in with fresh resources. These characters are often looked down upon by already established families, especially those opportunists seeking a leadership position before the landing ramp is even fully extended. There are also colonies with corporate or Imperial interests, where a bureaucrat offworld might send in new leadership that has minimal experience. Opportunists are, at their core, enthusiastic and willing to take any risk, but often lack a key understanding of the beings they intend to influence. In truth, this understanding can only come with time.</Description>

Curiosity? Boredom? Tragic circumstances? A desire for something more? Whatever it is that drives someone to wander away from his home and set out among the stars, it must be a powerful force to overcome the fear of the unknown. Most beings are simply overwhelmed by the sheer vastness of the galaxy, much less the uncountable dangers they must face each day as they ramble across the hyperlanes from planet to planet. The hardy soul who does so merely because he is drawn to is either exceptionally brave or a touch mad. Perhaps he is both.

The character finds himself embroiled in a life of adventure through no fault of his own. He could have been captured by pirates, the sole survivor of a deadly plague, or even something as mundane as being unemployed and forced to find some new way to bring in the credits. Regardless of the method for the character's push from society, he finds it nearly impossible to return to the way that things used to be. The character must quickly adapt to his new and dangerous situation.

 Once this character was the man of the hour, toasted in every shadowport from Kothlis to Nar Shaddaa. However, everything in this life passes in time, and whether through the machinations of a political enemy, the natural ebb and flow of popularity, or a legitimate mistake or miscalculation, the character has now fallen from grace. Where he once commanded legions, now he only commands the blaster at his hip. Where once he had limitless resources, now he scrounges for credits, his days of glory a distant and probably bitter memory. Regaining his former success might be his overriding goal, but it is just as possible that the character has given up on himself and simply wishes to avoid any reminders of his past.

Whether holocrons, ancient lightsabers, or personal journals, relics of the past are some of the galaxy's strongest connections to its once-thriving Force-using traditions, which are now all but annihilated. Some Consulars recognize these relics as tangible and vital links to a bygone era and actively seek these treasures of insight in forgotten and abandoned places. More dangerous than finding them is keeping them, however. Those who are caught carrying a Jedi holocron, Sith artifact, or other trinket are instantly branded traitors by the Empire. They are hunted to the farthest reaches of the Outer Rim Territories, and even beyond. However, this does not stop the seekers of relics. Consulars know that if balance and peace are to return to the galaxy and those strong in the Force are to have a place in it, a connection to the past must be maintained-even strengthened-with the recovery of these lost artifacts. Relic seekers who discovers a dark side artifact may unknowingly be carrying the very thing that will undo them, in the hope that it can be protected from the prying eyes and machinations of greater evil.</Description>

The Force guides these characters in their quest for truth, and the truths they find can shed light on even the deepest darkness. However, Consulars acting as rogue scholars cannot simply shine a beacon into the void. That would most likely get them killed. Instead, they pass on these vital truths to those who can use the information in ways Consulars cannot.

With the Empire now ruling the galaxy and the Jedi Knights exterminated, the failed initiates travel the galaxy, finding their own path in the Force.
[P]Other failed initiates received training in traditions outside the Jedi Order, taking lessons from hidden mentors and eccentric wizards before either striking out on their own or being forced into the life of a fugitive by the Galactic Empire or other organizations.

A few did their best to ignore their conscience. What united these con artists wasn't their criminal skills, but a nagging sense that life could offer something greater. While a criminal life doesn't usually lead to enlightenment, when these con artists sought  answers, they found them rather quickly.

Espionage field agents live in a world of deception and misdirection. Their true identities must be kept secret through technological, visual, audial means.

Spies are frequently after information that isn’t simply stored in Imperial databases. This can mean prying it out of individuals who know it or know how to find it. Psychological methods can provide an advantage in getting unsuspecting or uncooperative subjects to reveal what they know.
[P] Psychologists can thus be a great asset to espionage operations. Knowing the likely mental state and thought processes of an individual provides insight into what questions should be asked and how to ask them to gain a truthful and useful response.
[P]Determining how to ask a question and knowing who should do so are equally important. Insulting phrases, inappropriate protocol, and rude mannerisms can be detrimental and even reveal a Spy as a fraud. Crude and harsh language probably won’t get a Spy anywhere when dealing with prominent scientists or loyal Imperial personnel, but it could be exactly the right approach with underworld enforcers or smugglers.

Most, though, work for shady third-party resellers, used starship lots, or even criminal syndicates. In any case, repo specialists use a combination of bounty hunting, burglary, intimidation, and stealth to find and repossess their target. While they might have the legal authority to do so, their techniques work for either side of the law.
[P]A tremendous range of security systems is employed in the protection of starships and vehicles. Some vehicles have nothing at all or only require a basic key or code to access and start. Others have advanced systems with sensors for detecting innumerable methods of attack. While high-end and expensive craft can be expected to have many layers or protection, even relatively mundane or innocuous-looking ships could be so equipped, if the owner is rich and paranoid enough. Combined with ray shields, traps, or weapons, these security systems can be dangerous and even lethal to repo specialists.
[P]Of course, none of that matters if the repo specialist cannot find the ship to begin with. While repo specialists usually get some sort of address or suspected location from their employer, vehicle owners behind in their payments are unlikely to remain in the area if they suspect someone is after them. Additionally, hyperspace-capable starships could jump to almost anywhere in the galaxy, making discovery efforts even more difficult.</Description>
