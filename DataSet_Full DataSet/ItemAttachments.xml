    <Description>
      [H3]Augmented Spin Barrel[h3]

Using an updated and streamlined galven pattern and heavy-duty static pulse adapters, this custom barrel increases both the damage output and armor penetration of blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles. The trade-off for all this extra stopping power is increased wear and tear on both the frame of the blaster and the barrel, leading to an increase in maintenance and down-time. This attachment can only be used with blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles.

      [H3]Blaster Actuating Module[h3]

A Blaster Actuating Module is a blaster modification popular with mercenaries, bounty hunters, and anyone needing to make the first strike count. Adaptable to nearly any blaster pistol, this attachment is a simple upgraded blaster actuating module with custom firmware and a stronger electromagnetic accelerator that provides more powerful and more penetrating blaster shots. Unfortunately, this excess power takes its toll on the weapon, and blasters so modified tend to develop reliability problems the longer they are used with this attachment. This attachment is only for use on Ranged (Light) blaster pistols.

      [H3]Bipod Mount[h3]

Little more than a pair of folding or collapsible legs mounted beneath the barrel of a long arm, bipods are used to stabilize awkward or heavy weapons to improve their firing characteristics. Especially useful when firing from behind low cover or from a prone position, bipods are typically used on squad support weapons, or by sharpshooters and snipers to better steady their weapons. This attachment can only be applied to rifles, carbines, and light repeating blasters, and takes one preparation maneuver to set up.

      [H3]Bowcaster Re-Cocker[h3]

Few weapons in the galaxy are as indicative of their users as the Wookiee bowcaster. Bowcasters require an incredible level of raw physical strength to wield, especially when loading and cocking the weapon to fire. A time-consuming and labor-intensive process, reloading a bowcaster is made much simpler and easier by use of the automatic re-cocker. This attachment entails upgrading the basic weapon with a number of power-assist systems as well as a magazine feed system that allows the weapon to fire, re-cock, and reload all in one smooth, quick movement. These attachments are only for use on Wookiee bowcasters, and they cannot be purchased; they must be built either by the owner of the bowcaster with an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] or the weaponsmith who built the weapon for him.

Built from scavenged blaster parts and the occasional piece from a repulsorlift generator, the bowcaster accelerator enhancement is the second-most common modification to Wookiee bowcasters after the automatic re-cocker. Essentially an upgrade of the weapon's bolt accelerators, this attachment allows the bowcaster to fire its highly destructive quarrels with more force than typical in a stock weapon. These attachments are only for use on Wookiee bowcasters, and they cannot be purchased; they must be built either by the owner of the bowcaster with an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] or the weaponsmith who built the weapon for him.

      [H3]Filed Front Sight[h3]

An old assassin's trick, this is the simple act of removing the front sight of a blaster pistol by filing it off. A common modification to holdout blasters (along with removing their serial numbers), filing down the weapon's front sight allows it to be drawn more quickly from its holster, and reduces the possibility of it becoming snared on clothing. Unfortunately, while this modification makes for easy concealment and drawing, it also reduces the weapon's accuracy, as it effectively makes it impossible to aim with any amount of precision. This modification may only be applied to pistol-sized weapons. Applying it oneself requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]; the cost is paying others to perform the modification.

      [H3]Marksman Barrel[h3]

Merr-Sonn's KX765 Marksman Barrel was designed to meet the needs of the finger for whom long-range accuracy is a necessity. Popular among bounty hunters and assassins, this barrel is nearly two meters long and made of lightweight materials. It features upgraded static pulse adapters as well as a denser galven circuitry pattern that not only increases the weapon's range, but also its accuracy. The trade-off for this increased range and accuracy is a weapon that's slightly awkward to use and nearly impossible to conceal due to the length of the barrel. This modification may only be applied to blaster rifles.

The optic is connected to a pair of goggles worn by the user by a reinforced fiber optic cable that transmits the vision enhancements directly to the user in real time. This allows the user to see around corners and over obstacles. This attachment can be fit to any ranged weapon.

      [H3]Spread Barrel[h3]

Commonly applied to blaster rifles and carbines, BlasTech's "Scattergun" Spread Barrel is a common modification among spacers and fringers. Designed with close-quarters combat in mind, this attachment replaces a blaster's stock barrel with one shorter, bulkier, broader, and equipped with a built-in flash hider. Using a stepped array of prismatic crystals located at the end of the barrel as well as a reconfigured galven pattern, this barrel splits the blaster's beam into a number of smaller beams that exit the barrel in a spray pattern. Used in a tightly packed space, these beams can strike multiple targets with one pull of the trigger. The trade-off for this, however, is a reduction in the weapon's range. This attachment can only be applied to blaster rifles and blaster carbines.

It adds extra weight to the weapon it's mounted to, however, which makes the entire assembly quite barrel heavy. This attachment can only be applied to rifle-sized weapons (Ranged (Heavy) weapons).

      [H3]Under-Barrel Flame Projector[h3]

Uncommon but highly effective, the Firestorm by Czerka is a small, under-barrel flame projector designed to give an infantryman extra punch at short range. Illegal on many worlds and classified as a terror weapon, these weapons are typically used by only the most desperate or callous individuals. This attachment can only be applied to rifle-sized weapons.

Designed for use with the heaviest man-portable weapons, tripods are a common sight among heavy weapon squads. Used in static weapon emplacements to support heavy squad support weapons such as the Imperial Army's E-Web heavy repeating blaster, tripods use a number of different technologies—from self-extending hydraulics to tiny, low-output repulsorlift generators—to stabilize heavy weapons for firing. This attachment is only for use on light repeating blasters and heavy repeating blasters, as well as any portable Gunnery weapons. Setting up a tripod takes two preparation maneuvers.

Popular with both military scouts and assassins, optical camouflage systems are a wonder of modern stealth technology. Using a series of phased array optical projectors combined with sound baffling equipment and thermal and radiation shielding, Merr-Sonn's "Ghost" OCS can render a wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye. The PAO projectors allow the wearer to blend in with his surroundings by mimicking them, similar to an animal with active camouflage abilities, and the different radiation shields hide the wearers body heat as well as any electromagnetic radiation from other sensors or communications gear. For all of its utility, however, this system is incredibly fragile and is not recommended for combat. This attachment can be equipped on any type of armor, but is nearly useless on laminate and plastoid heavy armor, which is often too bulky and loud to mask properly.

Of course, such delicate and exacting work can make the armor less customizable in other respects.

Hydraulic control circuits are a throwback to an earlier era of shipbuilding. Instead of using traditional conductive material pressed into composite wafer boards to transfer electromagnetic energy, HCCs use countless, near-microscopic transparisteel tubes full of highly conductive liquid metal similar in its composition to mercury. Held under pressure and regulated by a series of valves, this metal controls the flow of energy. Bulky, antiquated, and difficult to work with, these circuits do have an incredible resistance to the effects of ion weapons, a fact that has not gone unnoticed among spacers. This may be applied to non-fighter starships.

      [H3]Reinforced Shield Generator[h3]

A good defense is crucial to keeping a starship operational in the rough and tumble space of the Outer Rim. P-K's AEGIS Shield Generators and other reinforced shield generators upgrade a ship's stock particle and ray shielding so as to make it stronger and to make the shields easier to manage. While the AEGIS improves only one defense zone at a time, further tinkering with these units has resulted in improved shield strength. This may be added to any ship or vehicle.

These are concealed compartments installed in starships, especially freighters and transports, for the transportation of contraband. Used to hide goods and occasionally people from prying eyes, they are incredibly hard to spot. Common places for smuggling compartments are beneath deck plates, behind heavy equipment, or in a thousand other bolt-holes throughout a vessel. This may be added to any ship or vehicle with encumbrance capacity 25 or more.

      [H3]SmartTranq[h3]

Developed in cooperation with CorChemCo, SmartTranq is an adaptable synthetic tranquilizer designed to be used with the Model 77 Air Rifle. When the tranquilizer enters the bloodstream of a target, it immediately begins to mutate, changing constantly and reconfiguring itself to find the quickest, most efficient way to overwhelm the target's defensive systems and render it unconscious. 

[P]Upon a successful hit with the Model 77, the target must immediately make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Resilience check[b]. If the target fails, it suffers 5 strain, plus 2 additional strain per [TH] generated on the check. If the check generates [DE], the GM can spend it to make the target check against the tranquilizer again during the next round. If the GM does so, increase the difficulty of the check by one. 

[P]Equipping the Model 77 with SmartTranq costs 500 credits. This does not change the weapon's profile—it simply adds the above special rule to the weapon. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, the user must purchase a reload (also costing 500 credits) before using the SmartTranq again.</Description>

Some sentients form a great attachment, even a bond with their weapon, and take steps to ensure that no other can use it. For this, or for more practical reasons, some individuals have their weapon modified so that it only functions in their hands. This is accomplished through a gene-lock: a system- featuring a computer that, once loaded with the user's genetic code, samples and scans the DNA of any individual who picks up the weapon. If his genetic profile does not match the weapon's designated user, the computer locks down the weapon and prevents it from firing. 

[P]This upgrade is most relevant for ranged weapons, but it is possible to gene-lock a vibroblade or similar weapon. In this case, an unauthorized user can still wield the weapon as a basic sword, etc., but any technological components such as a vibro-motor cease to function. This attachment can be applied to any handheld weapon.</Description>

One drawback to this upgrade is that the laser can alert an otherwise unaware target to the shooter. For these reasons, laser sights are rarely used by sharpshooters and snipers.

Originally developed to allow species without opposable thumbs to use pistols, a wrist mount ensures that the user always has a weapon ready while keeping his hands free. Many users choose wrist mounts as a way to pack further firepower, while it is simply an aesthetic choice for some. Wrist-mounted weapons can be fired with a pressure-sensitive palm trigger, a particular wrist motion, or even by neural link. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Light) weapon.</Description>

For some, it is not enough for their armor to simply prevent injury—it must lessen the effects of those wounds they do suffer. Integrated med-systems range from automated stim-injectors to sophisticated medical computers and full-body bacta baths. Though they can never replace a doctor or medical droid, these med-systems can keep the user alive long enough to get proper treatment, or to continue fighting despite his wounds. This attachment can be added to any armor that covers the majority of the wearer's body, subject to the GM's discretion.</Description>

      [H3]VX Hands-Free Weapon[h3]

By modifying his armor to mount one or more weapons, a spacer can keep his hands free for whatever unexpected needs might arise in combat—or just to carry more weapons. While few weapons are intended for such use, most can be modified to mount on a properly-equipped suit of armor. The difficult part is modifying the weapon so that it can be aimed and fired hands-free. Methods range from voice-activation to a pressure-sensitive glove activated by certain hand movements to a direct neural link. Such systems almost always incorporate a sophisticated targeting computer or retinal tracking mechanism. The most common location for the weapon mount is on the shoulder, though other areas are possible. 

[P]A weapon must also be modified in order to be armor-mounted, requiring one hard point. This attachment can mount any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon with an Encumbrance of 4 or less, subject to the GM's discretion.</Description>

It is common practice to incorporate a long-range comlink into a helmet. Many military or otherwise advanced helmets include a comlink as standard, and it is a fairly simple procedure to attach one to nearly any helmet. Some helmet comlinks are activated by tapping a button on the exterior of the helmet or somewhere else on the armor, while others are activated by voice or even a particular head motion.</Description>

Warriors must be aware of their surroundings at all times, and ready to respond to any threat. Because a hand-held scanner both requires the user to direct his attention to it and restricts his weapon use, it is common for military forces to integrate scanner systems into helmets. As usual, many Hired Guns follow suit, particularly those with a military background. Most integrated scanner systems utilize a heads-up display, projected on the inside of the helmet's visor. Some systems include a retractable mono-visor that extends only while the scanner is in use.</Description>

A repulsorlift enhancement increases the output of a standard airspeeder's repulsorlift engine considerably. Vehicles with this upgrade deplete their fuel cells at a dramatically increased rate. Since most races are relatively short in duration, and those that are longer have the opportunity to use a pit crew to recharge their cells, this makes them an extremely popular choice with most racing teams. Installing this attachment requires an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. Repulsor enhancements may only be attached to vehicles of silhouette 2 or lower.

While dipping a weapon in poison can be somewhat effective, a reservoir is a much more efficient delivery method. This attachment can only be used with Brawl and Melee weapons.

A threat monitor is a suite of motion detectors, electroreceptors, and photoreceptors that constantly monitors the armor wearer's vicinity and, through direc-tional auditory or electrical cues, warns the wearer of imminent threats and incoming attacks. While many find threat monitors somewhat annoying to wear, they can provide a critical edge in life-or-death situations. This attachment can only be used on armor and is typically integrated into the helmet, visor, or another place where the user can easily see it at all times.

Though generally not as loud as slugthrowers, blasters usually emit an audible crack or zap upon being fired. While military scouts and snipers are usually more concerned that a blaster bolt flash might give away their position or disrupt their night vision, those who operate in the galactic underworld often find the report of a blaster to be more troublesome. In order to address this issue, several arms manufacturers produce sound suppressors for a blaster muzzle, making the blaster virtually silent. This attachment can only be used with blaster pistols.

      [H3]Astrogation Droid Brain[h3]

To accompany its autopilot droid brain, Go-Corp has rolled out the CD-13z, an astrogation droid brain. Essentially an astromech installed directly into the ship's hull, the CD-13z can perform astrogation calculations on its own, but it is most useful for assisting in a pilot or navigator's own calculations. Despite their common origins, CD-13z droid brains are known to bicker with CD-12a autopilot droid brains when both are installed on the same vessel.

      [H3]Interior Broadcast Suite[h3]

As a result of their transient lifestyles, most smugglers must bring their own entertainment with them wherever they go. For many species, music is a primary form of amusement in addition to being an important cultural touchstone, and so many smugglers install systems that let them broadcast their chosen auditory entertainment across the vessel. While this can have a soothing effect if everyone aboard the ship agrees with the selection of music, it can also be a source of considerable fric-tion between crewmates, such as if one crewmember is extremely dedicated to Gammorean opera and the rest of the crew does not share that unique taste.

For some, this means keeping a refrigeration unit full of some favorite food, while for others it can mean well-furnished compartment full of libations, alcoholic or otherwise. Whatever the specifics, a ship with an onboard amenities unit allows its inhabitants to offer hospitality to any guests aboard their vessel.

Though no smuggler ever wants to use this feature, dumping one's cargo can mean the difference between jail time and slipping past the authorities to smuggle another day.

A blaster, with its focused energy, is one of the most powerful ranged weapons, but those who wish to conceal their shots are often forced to resort to other weapons if they want to pass unnoticed. Some assassins and spies prefer a blaster energy dampener, an attachment that significantly reduces the visibility of a blaster bolt, at the cost of stopping power. While dampened blaster fire is still noticeable in totally dark or very dim environments, an assassin can make a shot in a well-lit environment and not worry about attracting too much attention. This attachment is only for use on Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) blaster weapons.

It does not differentiate between heat generated by life forms and other kinds of heat, whether from natural or manufactured phenomena. (It is blind to life forms that do not give off heat.) This attachment can be used on any ranged weapon, with the exception of single-use weapons and weapons that would not realistically benefit from a scope.

This attachment may be attached to any weapon with an encumbrance of 2 or less.

    <Description>[H3]Barab Ingot[h3]

Rare variants of kyber crystals unique to the heavily irradiated world Barab I, home of the saurian Barabel people, Barab ingots are among the various crystals used in lightsabers. Found in small clusters in mountainous regions, Barab ingots are hot to the touch and glow with a fierce inner light. When installed in a lightsaber, they create a searing, fiery blade that bums so fiercely that it nearly loses cohesion. A lightsaber with an installed Barab ingot is slightly radioactive, and with a particularly good or lucky strike can set a target alight. A Barab ingot is a lightsaber crystal.

As their name suggests, Dantari crystals are found on the Outer Rim world of Dantooine. Discovered within the eggs of the kinrath—giant, venomous, cave-dwelling arachnids—it is unknown how Dantari crystals come into existence. However, these multihued kyber crystals were once extremely popular among the Jedi. When installed in a lightsaber, a Force-reactive Dantan crystal helps the wielder maintain focus and calm. A Dantari crystal is a lightsaber crystal.

      [H3]Dragite Gem[h3]

Small, dull, and brittle, Dragite gems are found in the caves and caverns of the D'olop mountain range on M'haeli, an agriworld in the Expansion Region. In their natural state, dragite crystals are one of the most brittle kyber crystals, and they produce a loud ringing when struck. Worked into a suitable lightsaber crystal, a difficult task due to the dragite gem's distressing tendency to fracture or shatter easily, it produces a blade that pulses and hums loudly. In addition to this noise, when a lightsaber equipped with a dragite gem strikes a solid target, it produces a deafening crack and a shock wave that can disorient and even cause bodily harm to its target. A dragite gem is a lightsaber crystal.

      [H3]Dual-Phase Modification[h3]

Considered antiquated and outdated by the time of the Clone Wars, the dual-phase modification is an artifact of an older, more violent time. Designed to catch an opponent off guard, this modification allows the wielder to change the length of a lightsaber's blade with the push of a button. This causes an opponent's guard to falter momentarily as he adjusts to the new blade length, allowing the Jedi to press the advantage while his opponent is confused.

The idea behind the extended hilt modification is to increase the lightsaber's striking i4 and cutting power by using the leverage of the longer handle and a two-handed grip to help focus the wielder's strength into the force of the blow. The extended hilt modification is also popular among Force users of unusual height or build as a way to capitalize on their size advantage in combat.

Ilum featured heavily in Jedi tradition, with young Padawans traveling there as part of their training to commune with the Force and use its guidance to seek out the crystal that would go into the construction of their first lightsaber.

      [H3]Krayt Dragon Pearl[h3]

Highly sought after by jewelers, artisans, and wealthy collectors for their luster, color, and refractive properties, krayt dragon pearls are perhaps the rarest of the crystals used in the construction of lightsabers. The terrible krayt dragons of Tatooine tend to live for an incredibly long time, and over the course of their lives will ingest stones to aid with digestion. While the caustic digestive juices of the krayt dragon can even break down stone over time, every once in a while these stones contain some form of kyber crystal. Incredibly resilient, they remain in the creatures' guts for the entirety of the dragons' lives, slowly being polished and smoothed into small, dense spheres of crystal. The resulting "krayt dragon pearls" are vanishingly rare, hard to acquire, and demand exorbitant prices. Since they are a type of kyber crystal, they can be worked into powerful lightsaber crystals—ones which produce an exceptionally savage and destructive blade that makes an unsettling howling noise when swung about. A krayt dragon pearl is a lightsaber crystal.

Lorrdian gemstones arc kyber crystals mined millennia ago by enslaved Lorrdians during the Kanz Disorders. Created by Force-sensitive Lorrdians to supplement the intricate kinetic communication developed among the slave populace, these gemstones were imbued with Force energies that allowed their possessors to read the emotions and actions of others. When installed in a lightsaber, a Lorrdian gemstone allows the wielder to predict the actions of an opponent, giving the wielder a decided edge in melee combat. A Lorrdian gemstone is a lightsaber crystal.

Mephite crystals are rare, lustrous kyber crystals found in a handful of places in and around the Adega system. One of five types of crystal known collectively as "Adegan crystals," mephite crystals are well-suited for use in lightsabers due to their internal structure and light-modulating capabilities. Like all Adegan crystals. mephite crystals are Force-reactive and can be infused with a small amount of a Force user's power. When installed in a lightsaber and infused with the Force, mephite crystals give off a small but steady Force signature that can be sensed by any nearby Force user A mephite crystal is a lightsaber crystal.

      [H3]Sapith Gem[h3]

Said to originate from a strange and mysterious world called Lwhekk in the Unknown Regions, sapith gems are similar to krayt dragon pearls in that they were formed when rocks containing a kyber crystal were consumed by a great beast. In this case, the beast was a massive volice worm, which died out long before the present day. Thus, the only way to find these vanishingly rare crystals is to dig them out from the fossilized remains of a volice worm. Shaped like serpent scales, these smooth, lustrous crystals have an incredibly complex internal structure, which magnifies the intensity of any light that passes through them. When installed in a lightsaber, a sapith gem creates a powerful, intense beam that can pierce nearly anything with ease. A sapith gem is a lightsaber crystal.

Numerous cosmetic or practical enhancements can be applied to a lightsaber, from rare metals and precious gemstones to customized grips and locking activating switches.

In the days of the Republic, the Jedi allowed their younglings to train with "training sabers," non-lethal versions of their famous energy blades. A training lightsaber is almost the same as a standard lightsaber; however, the crystal is replaced with a training emitter. The training emitter creates a blade that is completely non-lethal, and at most can generate a stun shock. A training emitter is a lightsaber crystal.

An in-helmet scanner provides the usefulness of a general purpose scanner in a heads-up display splashed across the inside of the users helmet. This feeds the user a constant stream of information about the surrounding environment. Depending on the specific model, an in-helmet scanner can indicate the presence of life forms or droids and display heat signatures, radiation sources, acoustic emissions, and more. Many can also scan and listen to nearby comlink frequencies. In-helmet scanners can be added to any helmet.

      [H3]Physical Countermeasures[h3]

Like electronic countermeasures, physical counter-measures are designed to fool scanners and make a ship or vehicle harder to hit. Whereas electronic countermeasures affect an opposing ship or vehicle's sensors, physical countermeasures are specifically designed to help a ship or vehicle evade incoming missiles or torpedoes. Countermeasures come in three basic varieties—chaff, flares, and anti-warhead missile pods. Chaff is a collection of small, highly reflective alloy streamers packed into a tube with a small explosive charge. When detonated, the chaff tube creates a cloud of glittering shrapnel that clouds detection systems and confuses most basic missile guidance systems. Flares are deployed in groups from special launchers, and consist of small incendiary devices that mimic the heat produced by a ship or vehicle's engines, fooling incoming missiles into following the super-hot flare instead of the vehicle. Anti-warhead missile pods are similar to flares, but they fire a cluster of small, low-yield missiles designed to intercept and destroy incoming ordnance. 

[P]While any ship equipped with physical counter-measures carries enough to get them through most encounters, engaging in a long, drawn-out fight can quickly deplete a launcher's store of countermeasures. Game Masters may spend [AD][AD] or [TR] on Gunnery checks made using missiles, rockets, or torpedoes targeting the starship to cause a countermeasure launcher to run out of its load of flares, chaff, or anti-warhead missiles, effectively disabling it until the end of the encounter.

      [H3]Gravity Mine Launcher[h3]

Gravity mine launchers, and their accompanying gravity mines, are small anti-vehicle mines produced by a number of arms manufacturers. While each brand uses its own patented gravitic technology, gravity mines and their launchers share a number of common traits. The mines range anywhere from the size of a slim datapad to a meter across, depending on their intended use, and are packed with advanced gravity well generation systems. When deployed, gravity mines create a localized area of intense gravity that can reduce the output of repulsorlift drives or even shut them down completely, stopping a speeder in its tracks. While they are often used in military installations to restrict ship or vehicle access to sensitive areas or to create firing lanes for weapon emplacements, they can also be used in sabotage or to lay traps for incoming ships or airspeeders. Gravity mine launchers are simple box-type launchers mounted on landspeeders that allow a vehicle crew to lay a minefield with relative ease. 

[P]The character piloting or operating the weapons on a vehicle equipped with a gravity mine launcher can deploy a single gravity mine anywhere on the ground within close range by spending an action. Once the mine is deployed, it automatically attaches to any other starship or vehicle using repulsorlifts that comes within close range of it. For every 1 mine attached to a vehicle that uses the Piloting (Planetary) skill, that vehicle reduces its speed by 1. For every 2 mines attached to a starship that uses the Piloting (Space) skill, that starship reduces its speed by 1. An attached mine can be removed with an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b].

      [H3]Astromech Droid Socket[h3]

Astromech sockets are typically found in starfighters, shuttles, and the occasional airspeeder. Installed during construction and fully integrated into a vehicle's systems, an astromech droid socket allows an astromech droid, typically one of Industrial Automaton's R-series droids, to access the ship's various systems through its SCOMP interface. A droid installed in an astromech socket acts as co-pilot, engineer, and radio/weapons systems operator, assisting the pilot during combat, monitoring onboard systems, performing astrogation calculations, and repairing damage on the fly. Most ships or vehicles can benefit from the inclusion of an astromech droid, especially those not equipped with an astromech socket. For these ships, Industrial Automaton sells a standalone astromech socket ready for installation in ships not already equipped. 

[P]Aftermarket astromech sockets can only be installed on ships or vehicles of silhouette 3 or higher. After a lengthy and involved installation process requiring heavy modifications to both the ship's hull and its onboard systems, the ship and pilot gain all the benefits of an astromech droid when one is installed in the socket. These benefits range from enhanced damage control to the ability to make hyperspace jump calculations. When installed on larger starships, this attachment represents can represent more than a single socket. These ships often employ an entire bay capable of housing multiple astromechs and deploying them to the outer surface of the ship to aid in repairs.

The demands put on a ship or vehicle's electrical system, both by the systems connected to it and by daily wear-and-tear, are enormous. Anything that draws power from a ship or vehicle's reactor, from the pilot's datapad charger to the onboard weapon systems, puts strain on every cable, every breaker, every bus plate between the system and the power source. Hardened circuits covers a variety of electrical transmission gear that, when installed, improve a vehicle or ship's power system and allow it to handle heavier-than-normal power loads.

Even the cheapest, most unreliable starships are durable items built to withstand the incredible amounts of abuse heaped on them by decades in space. Hull or keel reinforcement is an easy way to improve a vehicle or vessel's durability. Extremely old vessels, such as most of those fielded by the Rebel Alliance, can also benefit from a hull or keel reinforcement by shoring up damaged or fatigued hull members and adding support bracing at strategic locations.

For the most part, collisions with other ships, vehicles, or obstacles are to be avoided at all costs. There are times, however, when a desperate situation calls for a desperate measure and a pilot or driver must use his vehicle as a weapon. A number of bolt-on accessories for ships and vehicles are produced by major vehicle manufacturers that protect and reinforce prows or forward sections against collision. Items such as bantha bars, sloped fenders known colloquially as "nerfcatchers," and custom-fit reinforced hull plating are all examples of the rich after market dedicated to protecting a vehicle in case of collision.

An old shipbuilding technology perfected millennia ago, slave circuits allow ship owners to operate their ships, or various systems within their ships, via remote control. Occasionally referred to as the "Electronic Co-Pilot" or "Instant Backseater," slave circuits run all of a ship's systems through a central system bus that can be activated and deactivated via voice command through a comlink-like device called a "beckon call." Basic slave rigs allow a user to remotely activate a ship's systems and bring it to complete operational readiness, or to shut those systems down and lock out all users until a security code is entered. More advanced models allow the user to call the ship to his present location, and even allow it to fight its way there with moderate success. While popular in many circles, slave circuits are often mistrusted by ship owners.

The Empire's tight grip on the HoloNet forces the Rebellion to rely primarily on subspace transceivers for communications. However. subspace transceivers have a much more limited range than HoloNet transmissions, requiring frequent relays across additional networks before reaching the intended recipient. Risk of interception of a relayed transmission limits Rebel operations, forcing them to rely on courier ships and secret comm stations for long-range communication. However, ships with advanced encryption algorithms can send coded transmissions that blend with normal traffic, rendering them nearly undetectable and all but indecipherable even if they are intercepted.</Description>

[P]By adding a small electronic device to the top of a blaster or other ranged weapon, a small holographic crosshair is projected a meter out from the weapon’s barrel. This increases accuracy by reducing the time it takes for the user to aim. Unfortunately, the holographic crosshair is readily visible to anyone on the weapon’s receiving end, especially in conditions of darkness or low light. This attachment can be used on any ranged weapon that could logically benefit from the addition of a sight.

      [H3]Weapon Signature Reduction[h3]
[P]Both the Empire and the galactic security industry use weapon scanners that are capable of detecting a wide variety of weapon components. Even when broken down into several pieces, blasters and other ranged weapons are still liable to be detected, due to the specific technologies and substances that allow them to function as lethal weapons.
[P]In order to skirt such inspection and ensure that hidden weapons remain obscured from prying eyes, covert agents have devised modifications that mask or otherwise diminish such signatures in a weapon’s components. Though physical searches still pose some risk of discovery, weapon signature reduction guarantees that scanning equipment used to detect weapons is rendered less effective. Unfortunately, weapon signature reduction is only effective on weapons with an encumbrance rating of 5 or less. </Description>

[P]Lightsabers rely on kyber crystals attuned to the wielder to create energy blades of different types. Under normal circumstances, swapping out one crystal for another is an arduous process requiring the lightsaber to be disassembled first. Unsatisfied with this situation, a handful of enterprising (if unorthodox) Force users have created attachments that allow for two (or more) crystals to be installed in a single lightsaber. With the press of a button, one crystal is swapped for another, granting unprecedented versatility to lightsaber wielders looking for additional functionality from their otherwise traditional weapon. This attachment can only be applied to lightsabers.</Description>

      [H3]Force-Attuned Resonator[h3]
[P]When the Jedi artificer Sokiro Terebin set about reproducing the crystalline, force-attuned resonaters from the blasters she had unearthed at Site-145 on Filata, she first had to solve some numerous technical challenges. During this time, she created a number of internal resonaters that could be housed within a weapon the effectiveness of different technologies the ancients might have used. Though she meticulously recorded all of her efforts to create resonators that could be activated only by Force sensitives, the Empire's tumultuous rise to power led the destruction of many repositories of Jedi lore. During Terebin's lifetime, few Jedi considered these weapons to be serious armaments, but in the dark times of Imperial rule, some Force sensitives might find having a blaster that most people can't operate to be practical. The blueprints persist in certain scholastic records, and the aspiring Force sensitives might be able  to make a use of them. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon that has a trigger.</Description>

The simplest, perhaps, is to integrate a simple spotlight, similar in most respects to a high-power glow rod, along the length of a ranged weapon's barrel. In addition to providing illumination in dark conditions, high-powered spotlights have the potential to blind enemies.

The magnetic weapon tether allows the wielder to snap the weapon back to a readied position with a press of a button, rather than having to scramble to retrieve it. While many Force users might scoff at this ability - after all, why use a device for what they can do with the force anyway - others prefer to have the extra layer or safety, or wish to avoid using their Force powers openly in places where the Empire's presence is strong.

[P]Kimber stones are a type of kyber crystal produced by violent volcanic activity on the moon of Y'ness in the N'zoth system. They were once considered unsuitable for use in lightsabers due to the non-lethal nature of the blades they create. Certain Jedi Knights saw potential in kimber stones, and so a number were acquired from Y'ness prior to the destruction of the Jedi Order. Today, kimber stones are occasionally sold at auction on the black market, usually as mere trinkets by those who do not understand their true value as kyber crystals. A kimber stone is a lightsaber crystal. </Description>

      [H3]Sorian Crystal[h3]
[P]Though none can confirm accurately from which planet these mysterious stones originate, many traders recognize these gems by their radiance. Sorian crystals are said to reflect light in swirling, intricate patterns reminiscent of dancing flames. Because of these gems' relative scarcity, few realize that they are in fact kyber crystals. The energy blade formed by a sorian crystal surges briefly with the power whenever it comes into contact with another object moving at high speed - such as another lightsaber. The slight but sudden jolt  that emanates from the blade is often enough to throw an attacker off balance, giving the wielder a chance for a counterstrike. While this dded resistance also makes it harder to slice apart an opponent in a single stroke over the course of a long duel between skilled fighters, the unique edge it provides can make the difference between life and death. A sorian crystal is a lightsaber crystal. </Description>

With the addition of spikes, blades, and other protrusions on areas covering shoulders, knuckles, feet, knees or elbows, armor can be turned into a deadly weapon of last resort. The majority of such modifications are scratch-built, though a handful o f armor manufacturers mass-produce kits for the armor sets they sell. Largely popular with criminals, mercenaries, and bounty hunters, armor spikes lend an intimidating mien to anyone equipped with them. Some professionals prefer to keep such deadly modifications concealed and retractable, and these are perhaps the most dangerous of them all.

Low-friction coatings work by lowering the coefficient of friction against solid armor plates. With the addition of such a coating, the surface of armor becomes almost impossible to grip or seize. In addition, glancing blows from melee weapons are often unable to find purchase, which diminishes the damage they cause as they slide off. The only downside to the coating is that is can make working on the armor more difficult, as tools must scramble for a grip on its slick surface.

While largely supplanted by cheaper, more durable alloys, kiirium has properties that make it useful to armorsmiths, who can apply a coating of kiirium to armored plating as a relatively effective thermal shielding. This attachment can only be applied to armor that has hard or solid parts around which the allow can be coated, such as with laminate armor, heavy battle armor, and similar types of armor at the GM's discretion.</Description>

      [H3]Hardened[h3]
[P]Power armor relies on its energy source to maintain functionality. If this flow of energy is interrupted by a powerful electromagnetic burst or exposure to ion weapons, the armor loses both its mobility and its ability to enhance the wearer.  With the armor's vital systems "hardened" against such effects, power armor becomes immune to these attacks. Such hardening modifications are weighty, however. Adjustments must be made to nearly every subsystem to prevent even partial shutdowns from taking place. This attachment can only be applied to power armor.     </Description>

[P]A stun matrix is an additional defensive option for armor. Instead of enhancing the wearer's defenses directly, it unleashes a punishing pulse of energy that weakens the attacker in the hope of preventing a second strike. Installing this attachment requires the addition of insulation to protect the wearer form the effects of the stun matrix on top of the setup of the self charging battery and of the stun matrix itself. While the device is relatively bulky, it can be concealed if integrated subtly into a heavy armor frame, the better to surprise would-be attackers. This attachment can be applied to any armor that could logically benefit from having a stun matrix added. </Description>

      [H3]Reactive Plating[h3]
[P]Reactive plating is a modification that attaches small explosive panels to the armors exterior plates. When hit by an attack, the explosives are designed to detonate outward, absorbing some of the attacks kinetic energy with the counter-explosion. It is not typically used on a personal scale, but microrepulsors and other, similar technologies allow it to be integrated into certain heavier varieties of personal armor and to function at considerable effectiveness without harming the wearer in the process. Employed properly, reactive armor can even deflect or dampen blows from weapons that would cleave through other defenses, like lightsabers. Besides the considerable weight it adds to any set of armor, an unfortunate side-effect of reactive armor is that it destroys itself as it protects the individual inside. It causes the armor to degrade far more rapidly than it would have otherwise would, which means that the wearer must repair it far more often. This attachment can only be applied to armor with a soak of 2 or higher.  </Description>

Although most starships include sophisticated computers and comm equipment capable of slicing into the systems of enemy vessels, such electronic warfare tactics are usually overlooked in favor of more  conventional attacks. However, some crews undertake efforts to upgrade their on-board systems for precisely the kind of work. With the right equipment  and software, a skilled computer expert can become one of the most valuable crew members in a space battle. Many Technicians continue to tinker with and add to the ship's computer systems over time, sometimes to the confusion and frustration of other crew. This attachment can be applied to any starship.

Although it is possible to modify a ship's transponder signal, doing so is either easily detected or risks damaging the engines, depending on the method used. Mounting a secondary transponder to the engine is a one-time modification that allows the ship's crew to thereafter switch between two identities. When activated the secondary transponder overrides the data signal from the ship's primary transponder, while also generating an energy signature that disguises the activity of the ship's engine (these are the twp parts of a transponder signal).

Even aside from the threat of theft, there are many reasons why a crew might want to keep uninvited guests off their ship while it's unattended - especially for any crew engaged in less-than-legal pursuits. Upgraded mag-locks, decoy control panels, reinforced hatches and enhanced security protocols can ensure that a ship goes undisturbed while at port.

Most starships, speeders and other vehicles not specifically designed for it are unfit for usage underwater. Starships are typically not hydrodynamic, and hills designed for zero gravity and atmospheric use can suffer damage from deep-sea pressure. However, with the addition of turbines, modifications to the engines and reinforcement of the structure  almost any vehicle can be made seaworthy. This attachment can be applied to any vehicle or starship that can enter an atmosphere.

A favorite of scoundrels and pirates, decoy buoys are often devices cobbled together from salvaged parts, including transponders and comm systems. Although it might visually resemble nothing so much as a cylinder - or amalgamation of scrap parts - a meter or so across, a well constructed decoy bot transmits a transponder signal, emits ion streams and outputs other data and signals associated with starships. This attachment can be applied to any starship.

The craft's engines can be equipped with sublight boosters which considerably increase their output. Flying at higher speeds also makes the vehicle harder to handle in rough conditions such as asteroid fields, but when outrunning a patrol boat or pirate vessel, it can be the difference between life and death.

Many fightercraft lack shields, including most of the Galactic Empire's TIE Series. Of course, many pilots view going into battle without shields as a sure sign of a death wish, Soldiers of fortune and others who fight for credits rather than ideology tend to prefer the thought of living to get paid to the prospect of dying gloriously for some intangible ideal, and so the highly customizable AD-15 can be fitted with shield generators to improve its durability.

Walkers are stable, implacable and usually intimidating. For those who want true versatility from their craft, speeders and eve starships can be modified with the addition of a number, depending on the size and shape of the vehicle, of sturdy mechanical legs. In some cases, these might be mistaken for simple landing gear - until the vehicle begins to stomp forward. This attachment can be applied to any airspeeder or starship that can land on a planet.

From the depths of space to polluted industrial zones, radiation hazards both natural and artificial are a frequent threat to spacers. Although spacesuits provide a degree of protection and specialized hazard suits are available, some individuals prefer to also be protected from blaster bolts and blades. A variety of polymers, reflective coatings, and energy dampeners can be fitted or applied to armour to provide protection from radiation. This attachment can only be applied to laminate armor, heavy battle armor, and any other armor that can be fully sealed.

Not only does such extra plating provide additional protection, but it ensures that the wearer is never unarmed; after all, the gauntlets are heavy enough to shatter bones when used to deliver a punch. It also helps protect the user's hands in case they are ever stuck closing a blast door or shocked by a loose wiring while performing battlefield repairs. This attachment can be applied to any  armor with soak 2 or higher.

A visor-mounted heads-up display or holographic image streams the data the slicer needs, while specially designed gloves or gauntlets allow the slicer to manipulate code using nothing more than gestures and brief voice commands.

Although most fights are resolved with exchanges of blaster fire, a close-range firefight can quickly turn into a melee. When this happens, it pays to be prepared. Because the time it takes to draw a blade can mean the difference between life and death, some spacers equip their blasters with vibro-bayonets, essentially vibroblades mounted on the barrel of a gun. While a vibro-spear is not many Technicians' weapon of choice, having one at hand is considerably better than being effectively unarmed when combat takes place in such cramped quarters as the belly of a starship. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Heavy) weapon that could be logically mount a bayonet.

Many worlds are covered in cast oceans and no few species have evolved in aquatic environments. For those sentients without the evolutionary adaptation of gills, specialized equipment is necessary. With the addition of a sealed helmet and oxygen (or other appropriate gas) supply, nearly any suit of armor can be converted into an amphibious suit. Retractable flippers provide humanoids with improved mobility in water and other liquids. This attachment can be applied to any armor that could logically have an air tank attached.

Often seen among mercenary and special operations forces, an under-barrel grapnel launcher provides a quick way to scale sheer surfaces in the midst of a combat situation or during a covert infiltration. A durasteel hook, possibly with a mono-molecular point, can find purchase on nearly any surface, while a spool of synthrope or liquid cable provides up to 100 meters of length. A powerful motor automatically retracts the cable, pulling the user up - though holding onto any passengers who are along for the ride is a more difficult matter, and requires some effort on part of the user. This attachment can be used with any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapons that could logically have a grapnel launcher mounted on it.

Speciffically modified gas conversion enablers can allow a blaster pistol or rifle to achieve much higher rates of fire than those of a true repeating blaster. Along with modifying or replacing the XCiter, and potentially the blaster actuating module. Technicians making heavy modifications to a blaster also often modify the trigger to allow for fully automatic fire when the user keeps it depressed. Such high rates of fire mean a considerable loss in accuracy. Nevertheless, the advantages offered by a rapid-fire weapon outweigh these drawbacks for some users. This attachment can be applied to any blaster.

Adding a functional barrel to a rivet gun can give it dramatically more range and accuracy as a shooting weapon. Of course, such an addition also makes it obvious that the device is liable to be fired at range, as few Technicians can make a coherent case that they legitimately need to be able to bolt hull plates onto a ship with pinpoint accuracy at a distance of several meters.</Description>

Some sentients on the fringes of galactic civilization live a life of near-sonstant battle. For such individuals, a good suit of armor is vital, and keeping it in top condition is nearly as important. Some suits of armor include sophisticated self-repair suites, not dissimilar to the systems found in some droids. Smart materials, laminate extruders, electromagnetic assemblers and other systems work to keep the armor in one piece even under the greatest duress. This attachment can be applied to any armor with melee or ranged defense 1 or higher.

“Holo-tank” is a catchall term for a type of holoprojection
system used aboard starships and in military facilities.
Produced by a number of technology firms, holotanks
are large, circular holoprojectors mounted in
decks or floors, typically in the center of large command
centers. Real-time tactical data from friendly forces is
fed directly to the holo-tank, where it creates a threedimensional
model of a battle that can be observed
at various magnifications. Holo-tanks are instrumental
in planning and executing large-scale military actions.
When paired with proper tactical data networks, they
provide unparalleled battlespace awareness.

      [H3]Briefing Auditorium[h3]
Most dedicated warships, especially those in service
with the Imperial Navy, have special compartments set
aside for the briefing and debriefing of fighter, gunboat,
and shuttle pilots, ground vehicle drivers, and ground
combat forces. Before and after missions, pilots, soldiers,
and support staff gather in these large, well-lit
compartments to be briefed on their missions by a
senior officer, or to report on their missions and learn
how their success or failure affected the larger strategic
situation. Typically located close to hangars, barracks,
or berth decks, a standard briefing auditorium features
plenty of seating, access to power and shipboard networks
for datapads, a lectern or speaking platform, and
audio/video/holo equipment. These rooms and equipment
allow senior officers to issue orders en masse and
to make sure that all of their subordinates are properly
prepared for the mission at hand.
[P]While the Alliance to Restore the Republic fields some
dedicated warships, either decommissioned vessels
from the Clone Wars or stolen Imperial Navy vessels,
most Alliance ships began life as civilian vessels and
were militarized in an ad hoc fashion to fit the needs
of specific Rebel cells or fleets. Ships of silhouette 5 or
larger can be fitted with a briefing auditorium, giving
Commanders a venue in which to issue orders personally
and en masse to the troops and pilots under their
command.

“Electronic counter-countermeasures” (ECCM) is
a catchall term for a number of techniques, such as
FAST ECM detection, frequency hopping, pulse compression,
and polarization filtering, used to prevent or
break comms and sensor jamming caused by enemy
electronic countermeasures. ECCM suites require large
amounts of energy and often reduce the effectiveness
of a ship or vehicle’s sensors. On smaller ships like
fighters and shuttles, as well as in ground vehicles and
airspeeders, ECCM suites are installed in line with the
vehicle’s active sensors, and they can be activated or
deactivated quickly by the pilot or electronic systems
operator. On larger ships of gunship size or bigger,
ECCM suites are complex affairs composed of numerous
compartments and staffed by a dedicated crew.

Some Alliance operatives would gladly trade a little
reliability in exchange for the stopping power necessary to penetrate Imperial armor. This makes the Galven pattern resequencing a popular upgrade among
troops in service of the Rebellion. By focusing the Galven pattern into a tighter wavelength, more energy is
packed into each blaster bolt, which increases damage output. Unfortunately, the added workload on
the blaster’s tiny circuitry makes the weapon much
more prone to failure. This attachment can only be
used with blaster pistols and heavy blaster pistols.</Description>

Alliance troopers typically apply this upgrade to
blaster pistols and other sidearms to achieve results
similar to that of the spread barrel used on larger,
more powerful blasters. Beam splitters function by
modifying the Galven pattern and carefully mounting
three or more emitters into a honeycomb configuration inside a stock blaster barrel. Shots fired from a
weapon with this modification diffuse into a weaker,
spread shot rather than the typical blaster bolt, giving a single shot the potential to connect with multiple targets. Rebel troops often use this upgrade to
transform weaponry into effective standoff weapons
used to pin down enemy troops and hold chokepoints
in narrow starship corridors. This attachment can be
applied to any blaster or suitable energy weapon that
does not have the Blast quality.</Description>

      [H3]XV-09 Chemical Restraint Harness[h3]
The XV-09 Pacifier is one of the more uncommon products sold by Xenovet. Roundly derided by those who
make their living with animals as a cheap shortcut used
by quacks and animal haters, the Pacifier is designed
to control a wild or otherwise uncontrollable animal
through chems rather than training. Similar to a typical
riding or restraining harness, the Pacifier is made of a
sturdy and flexible synthetic weave that loops around
a creature's ribs, chest, and shoulders with a heavy
brace that sits at its withers. Built into the back brace is
a refillable auto-hypo typically filled with a cocktail of
behavior-controlling drugs. The auto-hypo is connected to a remote that can trigger the pump at up to close
range, and is used in much the same way as a remote
for a droid restraining bolt. While the drugs tend to
make even the most cross-grained creature docile and
biddable, they can also have a number of unforeseen
side effects ranging from dulling a creature's intellect or

[P]Using a Pacifier on a wild animal is a temporary fix at
best, and should only be done in emergencies. Mounting the harness on a creature requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Survival check[b] to ensure the harness is fitted properly
and the auto-hypo is situated correctly. The difficulty
of this check can be reduced by 1 with a successful
[B]Knowledge (Xenology) check[b]. If successful, the XV-09
grants [BO][BO] to any Survival checks made to control
the beast wearing the harness. In addition, creatures
that are successfully pacified gain [BO] to any Discipline
checks. Game Masters can spend any [TH] generated by
the initial Survival check to reflect one or more negative side effects caused by the drugs. The exact nature
of these side effects is left to the Game Master's discretion. In addition, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH]
or [DE] to reflect a catastrophic reaction to the drugs,
such as a heart attack or brain aneurysm, which results
in the animal's death. While safe for use on animals, the
powerful mixture of chemicals in the harness can be
dangerous to the minds of sentient beings. Attaching
the harness to a sentient being can result in permanent
brain damage and even death.</Description>

      [H3]Enhanced Hyperspace Shields[h3]
Few things are more dangerous to a ship than colliding with a mass shadow in hyperspace. Although all ships are equipped with sensors intended to detect a mass shadow and automatically drop the ship out of hyperspace, such systems are not infallible. As an added level of protection, some engineers modify a vessel with  enhanced particle Shields designed to potentially save a ship from complete destruction in a case of a hyperspace collision. Many captains consider the drain on ship resources and the cost to be too great for additional protection against such a rare event, but these systems save lives. This attachment can be applied to any ship with a hyperdrive.

      [H3]Podracer Engine[h3]
Podracer engines come in three varieties rocket motors, turbine engines, and high-performance ion engines. In the early days of Podracing, engines were salvaged and rebuilt by talented amateurs. Single-stage heavy lift rockets, ion engines from crashed starfighters, air breathing turbojets from performance airspeeders, and even more exotic engine types were hauled out of scrapyards or dug out of old military depots and put to use on the racing circuits. Today most Podracer engines are either hand-built custom jobs built by big racing teams to their own exact specifications or mass produced engines from one of the major manufacturers. No matter their provenance, they are all too big, too fast and too loud for civilized racing, which is what makes them so appealing for Podracers.
[P]Podracer engines must be installed in matched sets usually in multiples of two. Doing otherwise makes for a poorly balanced, finicky, unreliable Podracer that is  by its mismatched nature, even more dangerous than usual.

    <Description>
      [H3]Podracer Shield Generator[h3]
Most Podracers, whether custom-built racers or one of the many factory customs, mount a small, low-output shield generator in the cockpit. These shield generators are thin and cover primarily the very front. They only protect the driver, and only from exhaust wash from the engines and from debris kicked up from the track surface or flung at the racer by spectators (or other racers). They provide no protection to to the vehicle itself and are generally worthless in the event of a crash or other catastrophic event.
[P]Some racers, though, value personal safety over tradition, running powerful, full-spectrum shield generators that protect the entire vehicle. These are usually built specifically for Podracing and are tuned for the kinds of environments typically found on Podrace courses. Racing teams that are too poor or too old-fasioned to use factory-built generators still use salvaged units pulled from wrecked starfighters or emplacement shield generators.

      [H3]Podracer Control Cables[h3]
If Podracing evolved from ancient beast-drawn chariot and cart racing, as many historians suppose, then control cables are analogous to a set of reins. These long, flexible durasteel cables tether a Podracer's powerful engines to its cockpit. Along with keeping the engines and the cockpit connected, they also house the wiring that connects the controls to the engines. Steelton produces most Podracer control cables, but smaller companies have cropped up lately in an attempt to take away some of its market share.
[P]Nearly all Podracers use control cables, only a few small-production outliers, such as FG 8T8-T and a handful of one-offs and prototypes, mount the engines directly to the cockpit via spars. Control cables are the most fragile part of a Podracer, as even the stoutest set can be snapped or sliced through. A Podracer who loses her control cables through accident or sabotage loses control over her vehicle and must either eject or ride the cockpit to a stop and hope she survives.

      [H3]High-Output Repulsor Coils[h3]
Basic Podracer cockpits come equipped with low-output repulsor coils of the kind typically found on repulsorsleds and speeder trucks. Considered a secondary system at best, and really only equipped to keep the Podracer at altitude when standing still or at low speeds, a racer's repulsor coils are rarely given a second thought. Savvy racers, or veterans with years of racing and building experience under their belts, know that a good repulsorlift engine can often mean the difference between first and last place, or finishing or crashing. Upgraded repulsor coils increase a Podracer's maximum altitude, allowing it to clear obstacles more easily and even hop over lower flying opponents.

      [H3]Reinforced Engine Cowlings[h3]
Part of the thrill of Podracing is the near certainty of collisions, for many enthusiasts, a good race is measured by how many crashes occurred, not how fast the winner ran the circuit. Given the nature of these races, many pilots view it as foregone that they will be involved in collisions, no matter what effort they might take to avoid them. This leads to some adopting reinforced plating for their engines, the better to withstand "accidental" impacts as they occur during a race.
[P]More tactically-minded pilots take this even further adding ridges, struts, and vanes designed to appear ornamental or to a aid in aerodynamics, but instead intended to cushion impacts when their vehicle rams into another. That those pilots who are frequently involved in collisions and still manage to cheat death race after race, garner large amounts of fame (and credits) certainly has a strong bearing on other pilots decision to adopt such modifications and alter their racing tactics accordingly.

Podracing attracts a wide range of pilots, from those who delight in testing their skill against fellow speed enthusiasts to those who are only interested in winning, no matter what it takes. For the latter, one method is not to boost their own vehicles performance but to instead hamper their opponents Podracers. Using concealed compartments (known more informally as "dirty trick kits"), pilots can release small nails, reactive chemicals or other debris-designed to foul the engines of a training vehicle, slowing it down or even knocking it out of the running. Though illegal, when used out of the sight of officials these compartments can decide the fate of many a race.

Podracer handling upgrades encompass a wide array of systems and technologies designed to make Podracers easier to pilot.

While such upgrades do increase a Podracer's handling capabilities, no amount of modification is likely to likely to make the exceedingly fast and fragile race vehicle easy enough to handle for a human pilot.

This is a simple pilot's ejection seat, commonly found in starfighters and combat airspeeders. When activated, either by the pilot or by a dead man's switch, should the pilot become incapacitated, the seat and pilot are launched from the Podracer's cockpit by small, high-output, single-use ion engines. Once the seat reaches a pre-set altitude, it deploys a parachute or activates a small repulsorlift generator, which returns the pilot swiftly and generally, safely to the ground. Few Podracer pilots equip their vehicles with ejection systems, however, as most consider the added weight and complexity of the system no worth the small gain in safety.

Due to their speed and the primitive nature of their handling systems, Podracers are notoriously difficult to control. While a Podracer is blindingly fast in a straight line, getting one around corners with any accuracy or reliability is almost impossible, making crashes a common sight at races. As a result, many pilots equip their Podracers with collision avoidance systems to reduce the risk of crashes. While common collision avoidance systems are often barred from use in race series and are frowned upon by veteran racers, who consider them "electronic nannies".

      [H3]Etaan Crystal[h3]
These unusual kyber crystals from in the deep caverns of the Mid Rim world of Etai. Given that the crystals rarely form fewer than five hundred meters below the surface and usually at over twice the depth, the formation can be extremely difficult to locate. However, the raw crystals echo any nearby sound with a humming resonance, guiding searchers who draw near.
[P]Harvested etaan crystals retain this resonant property causing the activated blades of lightsabers using them to thrum in harmony with the motion of the blade, and to chime at nearby sounds. The blades respond especially spectacularly to a clash with another lightsaber or blaster bolt, emitting a near-deafening crack and a bright flare of energies. A clash of blades involving etaan crystals usually results in the lightsabers being forced apart, but reflected blasted bolts draw in the resonant energies from the reaction and intensify on their new trajectory.</Description>

      [H3]Ghostfire Crystal[h3]
These kyber crystals grow in nearly invisible formations on a handful of far flung Outer Rim worlds. Their precarious spires of entirely transparent stones rise from rocky foundations. They are typically found at the peaks of mountains, when they can be located at all. Finders can use ghostfire crystals to construct a lightsaber with a blade as difficult to detect as the spire from which they harvested the crystal. Lightsabers with ghostfire crystals at their core produce no sound whatsoever, and the blades are dim and translucent compared to the incandescent fire of the other lightsabers. most curious of all are the illusory afterimages of the blades that follow the wielders' motions, disorienting foes and disguising the true position of their blades.</Description>

      [H3]Reflex Grip[h3]
Through a delicate system of motion sensors and miniaturized motors built into a lightsaber hilt, a craftsperson can alter the lightsaber to respond to adjustments in grip and position with greater responsiveness. The split-second edge granted by this system allows a combatant to more easily parry an opponent's decisive stroke or block each of a hail of blaster bolts. Controlling the system and keeping it from overreacting to minute or inadvertent motions can be difficult to master, but the defensive advantage of a reflex grip can be worth the extra practice.

      [H3]Shien Reverse Grip Customization[h3]
Practitioners of Form V sometimes use a reverse grip on their lightsabers to assist in many of the techniques common to that form. Through a few careful adjustments to the grip and balance of their lightsabers, these practitioners can make the weapons more suited to wielding in this manner although the modifications make using a traditional grip somewhat unwieldy in the process.

      [H3]Overcharged Power Cell[h3]
Lightsabers are exceptionally efficient weapons, able to run nearly forever off a single basic power cell, thanks to the remarkable focus of the kyber crystal installed within and the contained energy loop of the blade. As such, tampering with a lightsaber's power cell and adjusting its output usually does more harm than good, as it upsets the balance of a near-perfect system. Those who know what they are doing can sometimes overcharge the power cell of a lightsaber to increase the power of the blade, but these changes make the power cell volatile, prone to causing unpredictable fluctuations in the lightsaber's effects. When installed correctly, the effect of an overcharged power cell is more often beneficial than it is a hindrance, but the mere possibility of the blade dimming at the wrong moment dissuades some tinkerers from taking the risk.

      [H3]Pistol Hilt[h3]
While the Jedi of old disdained blasters, modern Force users often need every advantage they can get. By adding a customized secondary emitter to a lightsaber hilt, the wielder can release the energies of her weapon at a distance in a manner similar to that of a blaster bolt. Without the focused field produced by a regular lightsaber emitter, the beam rapidly loses coherency and stopping power, producing only a short-range stun bolt. A lightsaber used in this manner, though might not even be recognized for what it is, appearing to be an unusual or custom model of pistol instead of one of the legendary weapons of the Jedi. This additional layer of cover could mean as much protection as the new capabilities of the weapon.
[P]The user must spend a maneuver to switch from one weapon mode to the other lightsaber function to pistol function, for example.

Riding tack includes a sturdy comfortable saddle designed for a specific beast and riding style, stirrups, headgear (bridle, halter, bit, reins, etc,), and a breastplate. Tack made for working animals replaces the saddle with a heavy duty harness that allows a creature to pull cargo sleds or implements such as plows.
[P]Tack can only be worn by riding or working animals. Using tack allows a character to ride the beast without suffering the bareback riding penalties detailed on page 73.</Description>

Many fightercraft lack
shields, including most of the Galactic Empire's TIE
series. Of course, many pilots view going into battle
without shields as a sure sign of a death wish. Soldiers
of fortune and others who fight for credits rather than
ideology tend to prefer the thought of living to get paid
to the prospect of dying gloriously for some intangible
ideal, and so the highly customizable AD-1 S can be
fitted with shield generators to improve its durability.

      [H3]Slugthrower Suppressor[h3]
Suppressors are used by assassins and sharpshooters to make their weapons quieter and more difficult to detect when firing. Similar to energy dampers used to silence blasters, suppressors clip or screw onto the end of a weapon's barrel, redirecting sound and escaping gases to reduce the noise and muzzle flash a slugthrower produces when fired. While they don't make the weapon completely silent they do dramatically reduce its report, making a shooter more difficult to detect. The major downside of using a suppressor is that in reducing the weapon's report it also lowers the speed at which a round travels, diminishing the weapon's damage in the process. Suppressors can only be used on Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy) slugthrower weapons.

Varpeline crystals are hard, super dense minerals found on the Outer Rim worlds of Mearalis II. Ranging in color from white to a rich gold, they are scattered throughout Mearalis II's extensive mountain ranges. When properly worked, varpeline crystals can be used to slice through nearly any substance known in the galaxy. While they are typically used in industrial cutting machinery or precision fabrication instruments, these stones are occasionally used to great effect as lightsaber crystals.
[P]When installed in a lightsaber, this crystal produces a blade that emits a short, sharp ringing tone when it strikes an object. A lightsaber equipped with a varpeline  crystal can often cut through the thickest armor or toughest materials, and have a disturbing tendency to dismember living targets.</Description>

Water reclamation systems are popular with scouts and hermits, especially those living or working on arid worlds. Produced by a variety of wilderness outfitters, like Survival Equipment Inc. and Gandorthral Atmospherics, these systems collect a body's waste moisture and distill it for drinking. Typically, the consist of a tight bodysuit worn under a suit of armor, that covers a wearer to the neck, wrists, and ankles, along with a matching pair of gloves and a filtermask that covers the mouth and nose.
[P]Made from layers of synthetic fibermesh, the suit wicks sweat away from the skin and purifies it by means of integrated filtration media. It also collects waste moisture from the mouth and nose by means of the filtermask. The water is then collected in pouches spread across the suit and can either be decanted into a larger container or drunk straight from the suit by means of a long, flexible tube connected to the suit's back. Adding a Water Reclamation System to a suit of armor allows an individual to operate much longer in desolate environments without fear of running out of water. This attachment can be applied to any armor that could logically integrate the necessary pouches and tubing.</Description>

Saddlebags are designed to be portable. They can be thrown quickly over a beast's haunches and, if necessary, removed just as quickly to be carried over the shoulder by the beast's rider. Saddlebags fit countless riding animals, and can be customized functionally and cosmetically to meet an individual's particular tastes and needs.

      [H3]Environmental Adaption Kit[h3]
      The varied and often hazardous environments found throughout the galaxy have a tendency to hinder and harm even the sturdiest, most well-built pieces of equipment. Ranged weapons, especially energy weapons like blasters, are particularly susceptible to environmental damage. Dirt, dust and sand can scratch fog lenses, reducing a blaster beam's cohesion and therefore its range and damage potential. Moisture can collect in barrels and receivers, corroding galven circuitry or rusting bolts and strikers. More exotic environments can wear away at weapons with heat, caustic gases, or damaging ionization.
[P]To combat these dangers, most weapon and weapon accessory manufacturers produce Environmental adaption kits. Primarily just collections of seals and protective covers, these kits grant a weapon an added layer of protection against the wear and tear of regular use in hostile environments. While some are for general use, most of these kits are designed for specific environments: dusty, cold, caustic, etc. Environmental adaptation kits can be attached to any ranged weapon.
[P][B]Models Include:[b] Various models and manufacturers.
[P][I]Note: If this kit is for a specific environment, rename the kit to specify the environment.[i]

Outlaw Techs have long known how to modify the gas
conversion enabler in a blaster to yield a more highly
energetic—and correspondingly more destructive—payload. Such modified XCiter modules are highly
unstable, however, and are sometimes disparaged as
being just as dangerous to the wielder and anyone
else nearby as to the enemy. Despite the risk and the
illegality of the modification, many outlaws seek out
such customizations to gain an edge in a firefight. This
attachment can be applied to any blaster.</Description>

Designed by Piccatech Ltd., the Pennier system is designed to fit as much cargo on a beast as it can carry in an efficient and secure manner. Its base is a specially designed load-bearing harness equipped with quick-release hardware. From this harness, a beast handler or teamster can hang a variety of secure, hard sided cargo containers. Made from either plasteel or reinforced fiberweave, the cargo containers are built in a variety of shapes and sizes to suit individual users' needs. The containers are equipped with an environmentally sealed locking lid that secures cargo and protects it from dirt, water and other contaminants.
[P]The Pannier Modular Cargo Handling system comes with two cargo containers and can only be worn by riding or working animals of silhouette 2 or larger. It increases the creature's encumbrance threshold by 6, plus an additional 3 points of encumbrance threshold for each additional cargo containers added to the system (to a maximum increase of 12).</Description>

Designed to increase range and accuracy, a hunting barrel can turn any blaster rifle into a dedicated hunting weapon. This two-meter-long replacement barrel is constructed of lightweight materials and packed with upgraded pulse adapters and denser, more aggressive galven circuitry. The increased accuracy and range come at the cost of the base weapon's weight and size, however. The extra-long barrel makes the weapon awkward to handle and fire without proper support, as well as making it almost impossible to conceal. A hunting barrel can only be used on a blaster rifle.

Minelayers, and their accompanying ordnance, are anti-ship weapons sold by numerous major galactic arms manufacturers. Mines are typically deployed in defensive positions, used to deny areas to vehicle traffic or to create fire lanes for weapon emplacements, but they can also be used offensively in a manner similar to missile or torpedo launchers. They come in a variety of styles—from simple concussion mines to sophisticated gravity mines—and grant a small vessel such as a starfighter or patrol boat, a damage capacity well out of proportion to its size. This attachment can be installed on any starship.

Individuals held in a containment field. Individuals held in a containment field wear magnetic binders and are suspended in mid-air, completely isolated from the world around them. When held in  a containment field, individuals are usually fitted with bio-signs monitors due to the field's distressing habit of causing heart attacks, brain damage, or death if it is not tuned correctly.

      [H3]Marked-Target Firing Lock[h3]
In the chaos of a firefight, shots can go astray, damaging property or bystanders. While some hunters do not care about the carnage they cause, this kind of haphazard damage is a liability, courting attention from the law or revenge from those who suffer in the crossfire. To mitigate this risk, some bounty hunters invest in firing locks on their blasters, allowing them to designate specific targets for the weapons. Once the systems' sensors have recognized a target, the weapons refuse to fire without a clear shot, minimizing the chance of collateral damage. This attachment can be installed on any ranged weapon that does not posses the Blast or Auto-fire quality.

      [H3]Shock Pulse Emitter[h3]
Shock pulse emitters operate along principles similar to a blaster's stun setting, but at much shorter effective range—a range short enough to be of little use as weapons in themselves. However, when shock pulse emitters are integrated into weapons intended for close combat to begin with, they become effective combat tools to debilitate opponents and make a finishing blow easier to land. This attachment can be installed on any Melee or Brawl weapon.

      [H3]Replusor-Assisted Lifting[h3]
Although more common among factory or warehouse labor crews than in battle, repulsor-assist systems have gained some popularity among bounty hunters who need to haul in heavy catches. The systems operate through a series of miniaturized repulsorlift generators placed at key joints throughout the armor, easing the weight of attached suits, as well as any loads they might support. Of course, the repulsorlift generators are tuned to reduce weight and pressure rather than exert force on their own, so some hunters prefer powered armor suits with lesser lifting capabilities but more general applications for their servos. This attachment can only be used with laminate armor and other full-body hard armor suits.

      [H3]Rocket Guidance System[h3]
Most micro-rockets are fired directly at their target, relying on the firer's aim and the rocket's acceleration to ensure a direct hit. For those who prefer more insurance that their rockets land precisely where intended, packages of sensors, limited fuel cell expansions, and adjustable maneuvering fins allow for rockets to be modified into maneuvering fins allow for rockets to be modified into "smart" weapons that continue to seek their designated target in the event of an initial miss or misfire. These systems enable users to get more reliable performance out of their rockets while at the same time minimizing the collateral damage. This attachment can be installed on any micro-rocket.

      [H3]Staged Rocket Booster[h3]
The limitations of size mean that most micro-rockets lack the fuel capacity to reach distant targets. However, high-yield fuel cells, advanced filtration systems, or staged boosters added to the rockets can all increase a rocket's effective range substantially. Of course, the term "effective range" becomes something of a misnomer with rockets modified in this way, as the additional fuel risks unbalancing the rocket's flight path, and the increased range comes with an increased chance of misjudgment on the part of the user. However, the chance to deliver a hefty payload beyond the reach of equivalent retribution is worth the risk to many. This attachment can be installed on any micro-rocket.

Through a series of specialized computer systems and sensors, this attachment collects and processes data from the wearer's surroundings to follow and predict the movements of designated targets. A heads-up display integrated into a helmet or visor feeds the wearer this information onto an overly of their surroundings. The systems are not limited to local targets, either, but can follow signals from distant communicators or tags and process optimal routes towards them. Tracking systems in armor are typically designed to operate alongside similar equipment, and are often able to integrate with other systems to a greater effect than the sum of their parts. This attachment can be installed on any armor.

    <Description>
      [H3]Blade Drain[h3]
 The Blade drain attachment works by creating a small power drain when in contact with another lightsaber blade. Once attached to a lightsaber hilt and wired into the power supply, the blade drain attachment draws energy from the power supply of an opponent's lightsaber via the energy blade contact is made. The draw is momentary but significant enough to reduce the effectiveness of an opponent's lightsaber, making it less capable of dealing damage.
[P]There is, however, a risk that the drawn power could overload the power supply of the weilder's own lightsaber as the excess power is stored, causing a catastrophic failure in the device. Users of this modification consider it a small price to pay for reducing the combat effectiveness of their foes, a tradeoff that could save lives. This attachment can only be applied to lightsabers.</Description>

      [H3]Pommel Cap[h3]
Force users, especially those walking a path closely attuned to the light side of the Force, often seek non-lethal means for incapacitating their opponents. The pommel cap provides just such a solution. The pommel cap is a small, weighted knob or other similar piece attached to the base of a lightsaber's hilt. The increased weight and reinforcement provided by the pommel cap make pommel strikes with the lightsaber more effective, and less likely to damage the lightsaber itself, than a strike with a bare hilt. The pommel cap not only enhances the ability of a Force user to provide a stunning blow, but it can also be used to store small items of necessity-most often an additional backup power cell, though any number of small items can prove useful to a Force user in need. The pommel cap screws into the base of a lightsaber, and competent wielders often incorporate its use into their fighting style as a matter of course. This attachment can be applied to lightsabers or any Melee weapon with a hilt.</Description>

      [H3]Hilt Masking Kit[h3]
Often, openly carrying a lightsaber causes undue comment and notice. Owners of such a weapon may have many reasons to want a subtler presence, yet still keep their lightsaber by their side. Perhaps they must enter an area known to be under heavy Imperial scrutiny, or the mere presence of an obvious weapon may sour delicate negotiations. Whatever the reason, Force users may make use of a hilt-masking kit to disguise their weapon.
[P]Just as each lightsaber is unique to its user, so too is each hilt-masking kit; there is no "universal" kit. The needs of the moment, or the personal tastes of the Force user, dictate what form each kit takes. Sometimes a hilt may be disguised as a cane; at other time it could be hidden as a part of a more mundane weapon like a blaster rifle; it may even appear to be something much more ordinary, like  a pair of microbinoculars. The cost, rarity, and encumbrance of a hilt-masking kit are the same as that of the item it is meant to look like. Whatever form the masking takes, it provides two important qualities: it looks as little like a lightsaber as possible, and it provides quick and easy access to the full weapon when needed.</Description>

Even the best of the Jedi can fall. The Empire scours the galaxy looking for the Force sensitives to enfold in the dark side. Untutored pupils wander far from the light, lost on dark paths from which they may never return. Many of them have either found or constructed lightsabers of their own with such crystals as they could and, in the course of their fall or their time astray, have committed heinous acts suffused with the dark side of the Force. They bend the kyber crystals in their lightsabers to their will, leading to the bloody red hue or are redeemed, they leave behind a weapon and a crystal strongly associated with the dark side of the Force. These crystals must be purged of their evil to avoid letting them fall into other hands and corrupt them as well. Thus, a Force user may take on the task of reclaiming these crystals. A corrupted crystal is a lightsaber crystal.</Description>

      [H3]Stun Blaster Attachment[h3]
Force sensitives trained or experienced in other fields prior to embarking on their current path may feel more comfortable using a ranged weapon before resorting to their lightsabers. Others may have reason to disguise their lightsabers, yet retain immediate access to them. Still others reason that if the threat of an opponent can be eliminated at range, so much the better for all concerned. While carrying a blaster pistol is one solution, some prefer a melding of blaster and lightsaber, perhaps believing that a personal weapon best reflects the Force user when it represents all aspects of the user's life, both present and past. Still, the tenets of the Jedi Order apply, and life is to be preserved if at all possible. The stun blaster attachment is seen as an acceptable compromise in these situations.
[P]By stripping down an otherwise functional stun blaster, wiring it into the power supply of a lightsaber hilt, and bolting the resulting device to that hilt, a Force user can make use of the blaster without relinquishing immediate access to the lightsaber. This cannibalized stun blaster has a shorter range. Due to the energy draw on the lightsaber's power supply, it cannot be used simultaneously with the blade, but it is often a useful addition to the wielder's weaponry. This attachment has saved more than one life on both ends of the lightsaber.</Description>

      [H3]Seeker Crystal[h3]
No one seems to know where these crystals come from or how they make their way into the hands of their users. Rumors persist of markets so dark that none but a handful of beings know about them. Other rumors suggest that these crystals have an entirely different purpose and only incidentally happen to function as lightsaber crystals with unusual properties. Still others say they come from the deepest edges of the galaxy, from stars yet unknown. Whatever the case may be, those few that are known to exist have served their users well, allowing them to avoid ambush and surprise attack. Users of these crystals seem to instinctively know when they are being secretly observed or when their charges are in danger from hidden assassins. When ignited, blades produced by these crystals glow a soft pink color and connect users to the Force in such a way that they are able to detect those who hide nearby. While it is not a compass pointing the way to hidden beings, a wielder will know without a doubt that a concealed foe is near. A seeker crystal is a lightsaber crystal.</Description>

      [H3]Cracked Crystal[h3]
With the destruction of the Jedi, the Empire has begun to horde kyber crystals for itself, capturing and controlling traditional sources of the crystals in order to develop strange new weapons. Force users must look for non-traditional sources of lightsaber crystals wherever they may be found, regardless of their condition. For example, with the destruction of the Death Star, a new, if difficult to access, source of crystals has been revealed. At the heart of the great battle stations lay a giant kyber crystal powering the lasers that destroyed Alderaan. When the Alliance destroyed Alderaan. When the Alliance destroyed the Death Star, the crystal shattered in the resulting explosion and scattered itself across the open space of the Yavin system. Most of the shards are unusable, either too small or too damaged to function, and many of them succumbed to the gravity wells of the planets of the Yavin system. However, some few remain, quietly circling among the remaining debris fields, cracked and unstable, but functional. Special lightsaber modifications are needed to use such crystals properly, but to the willing Force user, they can be made into distinctive blades. A cracked crystal is a lightsaber crystal.</Description>

      [H3]Solari Crystal[h3]
As rare as this type of kyber crystal is, some do find their way into the hands of Force sensitives highly attuned to the light side of the Force. Tales of solari kyber crystals come from the ancient past, and they have long been thought to be mere myths. However, they do exist, and it is a lucky Force user who can find one and make use of it. Or perhaps it is the will of the Force that those most in tune with the light side should happen upon them. They are not put to use lightly, though, for they demand much of their wielder. In exchange, they provide unparalleled protection against incoming fire. A solari crystal causes a lightsaber's blade to widen, thereby making much more effective at deflecting blaster bolts. A solari crystal is a lightsaber crystal.</Description>

      [H3]Droid Brain Detonator[h3]
Weapons manufacturers, combat engineers, and sabotage specialists are constantly inventing new triggers and detonators for explosive devices of all kinds, in order to provide for every conceivable situation. One of the most sophisticated and uncommon triggers makes use of an actual droid brain. Whereas timers, proximity detectors, and other common detonators are all effective within their narrow parameters, a droid brain is adaptable for nearly any situation or plan. A droid brain is able to abide by extremely specific trigger conditions and to follow complex instructions. For instance, users might instruct a detonite charge to wait thirty minutes after several specific individuals have entered a facility before igniting, or tell their frag grenade to avenge them should they fall in battle.
[P]Droid brain detonators are intensely loyal, even by droid standards, but they tend to develop distinct personality quirks over their relatively short existences. Some are annoyingly chipper and enthusiastic, perhaps owing to additional layers of obedience programming, while others exhibit anything from childlike naivete to nihilistic moroseness. This attachment can be applied to any grenade or explosive device.

[P]Many soldiers look down on the use of such systems, while others find the vibrations as the droid subtly adjusts their aim to be frustrating, to say the least.

Although certain models of mines include proximity detonators as standard, some desire this feature for grenades and other explosive devices. A proximity detonator adds an alternative trigger method: rather than detonating via a timer or on impact, the grenade only detonates when it detects the movement of a being or creature nearby. With the addition of a proximity detonator, a simple frag grenade becomes a deadly trap. A well-placed concussion grenade can incapacitate an entire squad of pursuing stormtroopers, giving Rebels better chances for escape.

Over the millennia, tinkerers, weapon designers, and desperate fighters have come up with countless delivery systems for explosives, from missile tubes to combat droids. One less-popular approach that nonetheless endures among certain demolitions experts is the use of a modified grenade or detonite charge capable of self-propulsion. Such modifications are almost always unique, although certain small droids and other devices are a popular basis, despite manufacturer warnings. From a proton grenade with wheels to a hovering thermal detonator, these makeshift devices-when successful-allow unparalleled control of an explosive device from a considerable distance. This is generally achieved via a small holocam and remote-control unit, although the addition of a droid brain detonator can be exceedingly effective. This weapon attachment can be applied to any grenade or explosive device with an encumbrance value of 3 or less.</Description>

      [H3]Automated Weapon Mounting[h3]
Used by elite special forces across the galaxy-and the occasional bounty hunter-an automated weapon mounting is a sophisticated pseudocybernetic that allows the user to fire a blaster or other handheld weapon while keeping both hands free, possibly for additional weapons. Automated harnesses are most commonly shoulder mounted, although a variety of models are available, some incorporating articulated appendages of up to a half meter in length. Sappers and combat engineers often find automated weapon mountings particularly useful , particularly when combined with a droid brain targeting system, as the mountings allow them to effect battlefield repairs without leaving themselves vulnerable. An automated weapon mounting may be activated by voice or neural link. For obvious reasons, these attachments are rarely seen outside of a battlefield, and they are outlawed on most worlds.
[P]A weapon must also be modified in order to be armor-mounted, requiring one hard point.</Description>

      [H3]Droid Brain Defense System[h3]
An extremely unusual upgrade generally reserved for powered armor suits, a droid brain defense system uses a full sensor suite to alert wearers to and help them avoid threats. The most basic models simply warn the user of threats and indicate ideal cover positions through a haptic interface or by voice. More advanced models incorporate a system of complex motors or even repulsor generators throughout the armor to literally throw the wearer out of the way of incoming fire. These droids often develop highly paranoid personalities, and their earnest attempts to protect their master even outside of combat can prove highly inconvenient.</Description>

      [H3]Repulsor Pack[h3]
While lacking the range and power of a true jetpack, a repulsor pack provides a reliable-and less terrifying-alternative for those new to the realm of personal flight devices. A repulsor pack allows for controlled descents from nearly any height, as well as hovering speeds of up to thirty-five kilometers per hour, its name being something of a misnomer, a repulsor pack actually consists of a number of small, relatively low-powered repulsor lifts mounted to the user's torso and limbs. Although the sight of an experienced user gliding through the air is quite impressive, the learning curve is steep. Perhaps due to the importance of leg movement in most packs for controlling movement and speed, the devices are sometimes disparagingly called "jet pants."</Description>

For some species, it's a mystery how humans and their ilk get by with only two arms. In fact, it's often said that the first armor-mounted utility arm was invented by a Dug Engineer, although another tale attributes its origin to a cybernetics manufacturer with a product surplus. Regardless of its origin, the utility arm is now a common tool for Engineers and technicians of all species. Mounted on a harness or suit of combat armor, a utility arm is a mechanical appendage similar in function to many cybernetic and droid arms and ending in a manipulating "hand." Although utility arms are most often used to increase workshop productivity, combatants of all kinds have found them useful on the battlefield.</Description>

It's a tragic fact that all too often, the brave members of the Alliance fail to return from a mission. Nevertheless, even a failed mission can provide useful data for the cause and prevent such deaths in the future. In such cases, an armored computer core provides an opportunity for the Rebellion to recover a record of the mission from even the most devastated wrecks. Layers of laminamium plating, redundant data backups, and sometimes even an ejection failsafe ensure the survival of a computer core storing astrogation data, a record of ship activity, and-assuming mission leaders fulfill their duty-a log of the mission. Should the worst come to pass, the armored computer core can survive the ship's complete destruction, and is practically indistinguishable from the debris.</Description>

Some obstacles are insurmountable for even the most versatile and powerful of factory-standard repulsor field generators. For tinkerers willing to ignore a whole host of safety warnings-and likely a few laws-most repulsor field generators can be pushed past factory limits, allowing for a drastic, if brief, increase in lift. Such an increase can allow the vehicle to "jump" over objects, gaps, or enemy vehicles or to higher ground. Some field mechanics have even been known to add specially overcharged repulsor fields to vehicles that rely on a different method of propulsion, just in case. More than one team of Rebel soldiers has escaped certain death in the face of overwhelming Imperial opposition, thanks to just such modifications.</Description>

    <Description>
      [H3]Sensor Baffler[h3]
Using combination of broad-spectrum transmissions and low-power targeted ion pulses, a sensor baffler confuses enemy sensors, preventing them from determining a ship's precise location. A sensor baffler is not a passive system, but actively confuses enemy sensors, providing contradictory and nonsensical readings. As a result, the system does not truly conceal the ship's presence from enemies. Even inexperienced sensor operators can easily see that something is interfering with their system, but they are frustratingly unable to pinpoint the source. A sensor baffler does not include optical camouflage, and it has no effect on visible detection. Despite its shortcomings, a sensor baffler has lower power requirements and requires a less-sophisticated manufacturing process than a true cloaking device. This makes it an attractive alternative to those nearly unheard-of devices, and one available to a wider variety of ship types.</Description>

While most lightsabers have synthetic hilts, Tholothian Jedi preferred a more organic approach. At their height, they crafted heartwood hilts from the timber of still-living trees The wood was then preserved in a specialized ritual-one more often used when a heartwood tree was dying. The resulting hilt is resistant to decay and can house a lightsaber's apparatus. The resulting lightsabers are beautiful works of art as much as they are weapons. The resins used to preserve the timber increase its weight, and wielders must take appropriate care in using them. This often translates to a stronger and more deliberate strike when this weapon does connect.</Description>

Often, particularly elderly Jedi constructed their lightsabers in the body of a sturdy walking stick. If the blade is a Jedi's life, why shouldn't it make things a little easier? The pure utility of this practice fell out of favor with the Jedi Order. Most elderly Jedi did not, after all, survive the Purge. Survivors, though, found a similar technique could hide their weapons in plain sight. This concealment does come with a cost. The awkward size and inconsistent weighting often interferes with use in heated combat.</Description>

The Nightsisters rose and fell as a faction untouched by the conflicts between Jedi and Sith. As such, they had little time to adopt the iconic lightsabers as their weapons of choice. This has not stopped dark side Mystics from trying to fuse Nightsister magic with Sith weaponry. Most experiments yield no fruit, but some have made for particularly terrifying advancements. Tainted Nightsister crystals were once pure Kyber crystals. Soaking them in Dathomiri Waters of Life perverts their connection to the Force. The resulting blade emits a choking, putrid green smoke when active.</Description>

The Kyber crystal is the heart of a lightsaber, but as with the hearts of organic beings, there can be imperfections. There are many opportunities between mining and use for a crystal to become unstable. It could develop hairline fractures in initial transit. Its wielder might subject it to extreme stress in use. Either way, power can begin to leak out of the crystal itself.
[P]Under normal circumstances, these imperfections will not affect a lightsaber's performance. With the right knowledge, however, a Force user can harness the leaking energy for their own ends. By performing a lengthy ritual with the lightsaber, a Mystic can draw some of its power into themselves for a time.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Cracked Jedha Crystal[h3]
When a terrible mining accident destroyed Jedha City, the galaxy lost one of the last known sources of kyber crystals. The crystals produced on Jedha held great spiritual significance for the Jedi, the Church of the Force, and a number of other religious traditions. Jedha crystals were among the most popular kyber crystals for the Jedi. As a practical matter, Jedha crystals produce focused, potent lightsaber blades, but many Jedi valued the knowledge that their lightsaber housed an artifact from Jedha. For those who seek to follow in the Jedi's path, kyber crystals have become vanishingly rare in recent years. However, a small number of Jedha crystals have  been recovered from the ruins of Jedha City. Unfortunately, many of these crystals are cracked and damaged, producing unstable, ragged lightsaber beams.

    <Description>[H3]Flickerphase Blade[h3]
Considered dishonorable and unsporting by most Jedi, so-called flickerphase modifications were never widely adopted. With a few simple modifications, a lightsaber can be made to intermittently and randomly ignite and extinguish its blade, making it appear to fIicker on and off. While this unpredictable element adds some difficulty for the wielder, it is almost impossible for an opponent to time blocks and parries effectively.

A delicately tuned magnetic field maintains the coherency of a lightsaber's plasma beam. Though this modification increases the strength of a lightsaber's magnetic shielding, the blade takes on some of the qualities of a solid weapon. With this modification, the wielder gives up some of the lightsaber's legendary penetrative capacity in order to deliver punishing electromagnetic impacts.

When broken down, a componentized weapon looks like a collection of basic tools, comlinks, glow rods, datapad styluses, and other items any individual might be expected to carry. Each part also functions as that item as well. It takes two maneuvers to assemble or disassemble a weapon with this mod. Loss of or damage to a component ruins the weapon, and another will have to be acquired and modified. This attachment can be applied to any weapon with an encumbrance of 2 or less.

Scanner-proof hardware is a collection of upgrades that together make a weapon virtually invisible to scanners. This mod typically replaces a weapon's stock, foregrip, and any other furniture with lightweight poly-carbonates woven with scanner-spoofing fibers. In addition, most if not all metallic parts—frame, trigger group, barrel, etc.—are replaced with fiber-reinforced polycarb pieces. This mod is extremely illegal. Being caught with a weapon that can pass through scanners without being detected is usually a one-way ticket to the nearest Imperial stockade. This attachment can be applied to any weapon.

There are various ways to deploy the blades, such as pressing a certain point on the tongue of a shoe or stamping hard with a boot's heel. Retracting them often entails simply (but carefully) pushing them back into their compartment until they catch.

They use a combination of optical camouflage, low-output cloaking technology, active electromagnetic dampers, electronic acoustic bafflers, and thermal shielding to make a user virtually invisible to both the naked eye and to most scanners. These systems are not perfect, however. Users still need to know how to move stealthily and how to use cover and shadows to their advantage. Users also cannot move faster than a walk, or the stealth field will break down. This attachment can be applied to any armor.

Dart guns are often concealed in comlinks, glow rods, cigarras, and other cylindrical items, but they can be used anywhere for both offensive and defensive purposes.

These are typically very small, easily concealed compartments hidden in places such as the hollowed-out handle of a blaster pistol or the heel of a shoe. Due to size constraints, they can typically only hold items with an encumbrance of 0, such as mem-stiks and credit chips. Compartments that can hold items with an encumbrance of 1 or 2 can be built into larger items, such as a false bottom in a document case.

Subminiature holocams are small holorecorders equipped with a medium-sized fixed focal length lens. Able to record still images and video in numerous formats, they are often hidden in datapads, eyeglasses, goggles, or jewelry. Due to their size and the nature of the attached lens, they have relatively limited capabilities. The on-board storage can store only a handful of still images or a few minutes of video, and the images are all low-resolution. Unless the subminiature holocam is specifically built for the task, it can only reliably record up to a range of three meters. In addition, miniature holocams rarely, if ever, have networking capabilities; images and video footage must be removed manually by connecting the device to a datapad or computer.

    <Description>[H3]Concealment Alteration (Weapon)[h3]
Holdout blasters and vibroknives are easy enough to hide, but when characters wish to pack a bit more of a punch, they need a more powerful (and usually larger) weapon. The simplest way to make a more obvious weapon or other item easier to conceal is to remove unnecessary parts or minimize its size. This is called a concealment alteration. Concealment alterations can include cutting weapon barrels, removing panels, and any other small physical changes that do not prohibit the item's primary function.
[P]PCs wishing to make a concealment alteration need to make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b] and spend one hour per point of the item's encumbrance (with a minimum duration of one hour) in applying the changes. A successful check reduces the item's encumbrance by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and adds [SE] to any Perception checks to notice or search for the item; [TR] can be spent to make this [SE][SE] instead. Items with an encumbrance of 3 or higher are more difficult to modify, however, and so the difficulty to perform a concealment alteration increases by one for each point of encumbrance over 2. This means that making a concealment alteration to a typical ion blaster (encumbrance 3) would require a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b], while doing so to a standard disruptor rifle (encumbrance 5) would require a [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b]. Items with an encumbrance of 6 or higher cannot receive a concealment alteration. 
[P]A character can only attempt a concealment alteration once on a given item, and doing so permanently reduces the item's available hard points by 1. Items that have no hard points may still be altered in this fashion.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Component Alteration (Weapon)[h3]
A more drastic, but more effective, option is to alter a weapon or other device so that it can be broken down into several smaller parts that can be reassembled later. This method is typically used when a Rebel needs to get a larger item into a secure location or to avoid scanning devices that are likely to detect standard weapons regardless of any concealment alterations. This is called a component alteration.
[P]Characters wishing to break a weapon or other item down into several parts in this fashion need to spend time dismantling the device into smaller components. This requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] and takes a number of hours equal to the item's encumbrance, or a minimum of one hour. If the check is successful, the device is broken down into a number of components equal to its encumbrance plus 1. So, a blaster pistol is broken down into two components, while a blaster rifle is broken down into five.
[P]Note that this differs from the more advanced componentization weapon attachment, which requires no check for use once it is installed and is designed to allow the user to openly carry a weapon, rather than consisting of a simple mechanical disassembly. Characters can try, though, to use component alteration to physically disguise these individual parts to look like code cylinders, comlinks, fusion lanterns, and other mundane objects. While this allows a part to take on the rough appearance of the desired object, it does not gain the functionality of that object. This is generally a taxing and tricky process, and so upgrades the difficulty of the Mechanics check once or more as per the GM's discretion.
[P]Each [SU] or [TR] on the initial Mechanics check lets a character carrying the components from a component alteration add [BO] to [B]opposed Stealth vs. Perception checks[b] when an observer attempts to notice the true nature of the disassembled device. If the component alteration was designed to make the items appear mundane, he gains [BO][BO] instead.
[P]Assembling a weapon or other item with a component alteration requires two maneuvers or two minutes of narrative time per component, and the character must make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. All components must be present to make the check. Failure means the components are damaged and the device requires a major repair to be properly reassembled again and returned to function. 
[P]Component alterations have a strong impact on a item's reliability, as most weapons or other complex devices simply aren't meant to be broken down into smaller pieces and reassembled. The GM may spend [TH][TH][TH] as [DE] when a character makes a skill check while using an item with this alteration. 
[P]A character can only attempt a component alteration once on a given item, and doing so permanently reduces the item's available hard points by 1. Items that have no hard points may still be altered in this fashion.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Component Alteration (Gear)[h3]
A more drastic, but more effective, option is to alter a weapon or other device so that it can be broken down into several smaller parts that can be reassembled later. This method is typically used when a Rebel needs to get a larger item into a secure location or to avoid scanning devices that are likely to detect standard weapons regardless of any concealment alterations. This is called a component alteration.
[P]Characters wishing to break a weapon or other item down into several parts in this fashion need to spend time dismantling the device into smaller components. This requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] and takes a number of hours equal to the item's encumbrance, or a minimum of one hour. If the check is successful, the device is broken down into a number of components equal to its encumbrance plus 1. So, a blaster pistol is broken down into two components, while a blaster rifle is broken down into five.
[P]Note that this differs from the more advanced componentization weapon attachment, which requires no check for use once it is installed and is designed to allow the user to openly carry a weapon, rather than consisting of a simple mechanical disassembly. Characters can try, though, to use component alteration to physically disguise these individual parts to look like code cylinders, comlinks, fusion lanterns, and other mundane objects. While this allows a part to take on the rough appearance of the desired object, it does not gain the functionality of that object. This is generally a taxing and tricky process, and so upgrades the difficulty of the Mechanics check once or more as per the GM's discretion.
[P]Each [SU] or [TR] on the initial Mechanics check lets a character carrying the components from a component alteration add [BO] to [B]opposed Stealth vs. Perception checks[b] when an observer attempts to notice the true nature of the disassembled device. If the component alteration was designed to make the items appear mundane, he gains [BO][BO] instead.
[P]Assembling a weapon or other item with a component alteration requires two maneuvers or two minutes of narrative time per component, and the character must make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. All components must be present to make the check. Failure means the components are damaged and the device requires a major repair to be properly reassembled again and returned to function. 
[P]Component alterations have a strong impact on a item's reliability, as most weapons or other complex devices simply aren't meant to be broken down into smaller pieces and reassembled. The GM may spend [TH][TH][TH] as [DE] when a character makes a skill check while using an item with this alteration. 
[P]A character can only attempt a component alteration once on a given item, and doing so permanently reduces the item's available hard points by 1. Items that have no hard points may still be altered in this fashion.</Description>

    <Description>[H3]Hidden Compartments in Armor[h3]
Usually formed from rigid plates or packed with protective padding, most types of armor rarely facilitate the stowing of small objects. However, with some careful work, a character can add hidden pouches, concealed holsters, and unseen sheaths. 
[P]A character typically shaves down or hollows out a section of armor plating, or thins out protective mesh and padding, to make space for the hidden compartment. To make this change, he must spend a number of hours equal to the armor's encumbrance, pay a number of credits equal to 5% of the armor's price, and make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. Each [SU] or [TR] provides one encumbrance point's worth of hidden space in the armor. The armor cannot gain more encumbrance points for hiding objects than the suit's own encumbrance value, and items concealed in this way do not count towards the user's encumbrance threshold. Add [SE][SE] to all Perception checks made to notice items hidden in this manner. 
[P]No matter how many [SU] are rolled, though, a suit of armor cannot conceal any single item with an encumbrance value greater than 2. This means that if a character rolls [SU][SU][SU] and thus has space for items totaling 3 encumbrance, the character could conceal a heavy blaster pistol (encumbrance 2) and a vibroknife (encumbrance 1), but not a blaster carbine (encumbrance 3). This is because while it is possible to hollow out a compartment in a chest plate and perhaps a second in a boot, there is no single location on a suit of armor large enough to accommodate a particularly large or unwieldy item. 
[P]Each point of encumbrance value for concealed space gained in this fashion reduces the armor's hard points by one, to a minimum of 0. Any armor with no hard points, such as padded armor or heavy clothing, can still have enough concealed space for an item with an encumbrance value of 1.
[P]For every two encumbrance points' worth of concealed space created, an armor's soak is reduced by one. However, each net [AD] on the initial Mechanics check to modify the armor cancels out one point of soak reduction.</Description>

Some physical alterations, no matter how extensive, can't fool the piercing eyes of scanners and electronic detection devices. However, clever Rebels aren't without hope. By reducing the energy output of a weapon or by installing jury-rigged scramblers to shield a device from sensory devices, a character can potentially allow the item to evade detection. 
[P]Characters attempting such an alteration must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]. This adds [SE] to Perception checks that operators using a scanning device make to detect the item. They may spend [TR] from the Mechanics check to have the difficulty of such detection checks upgraded once.
[P]Unfortunately, the reduction of a weapon's energy output does diminish its effectiveness. Each net [SU] from the check for reducing a weapon's energy output also reduces its damage by one, to a minimum of 1. Characters may spend [TR] from the Mechanics check to halve this reduction in damage, rounding up. 
[P]Only weapons that use energy-based attacks or other advanced devices can have their energy output reduced or signature concealed. This means that slugthrowers and traditional explosive devices cannot be modified in this fashion. In addition, items that require extensive power (such as repeating blasters) cannot have their energy signature reduced. Note that this differs from the scanner-proof hardware weapon attachment, which requires no check for use once it is installed and is more a customization of the weapon than a mechanical alteration.</Description>
