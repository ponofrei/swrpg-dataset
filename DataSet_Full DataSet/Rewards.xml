    <Description>[H3]Battle Scar[h3]  
Each battle scar is as unique as the story behind it, and players and GMs should work together to craft the narrative for how a particular injury or scar manifests in the corresponding talent. Still, the majority of battle scars fit into certain categories. Each of the following types of battle scar includes a list of recommended Critical Injury results and talents. After the GM grants a character a battle scar, that PC's player should find the Critical Injury result his character suffered and select one of the corresponding talents, then work with the GM to devise an explanation for the mechanical benefit. These categories and lists are only recommendations, however, and players and GMs might decide that particularly unusual or interesting wounds lend themselves to talents not listed here. [BR][BR] The GM always has the final say on what talents are available for a given battle scar, regardless of the recommendations given below. As a general rule an individual PC should not be able to acquire more than three battle scars-though, at the GM's discretion, a PC might be able to replace an old battle scar with a new one, exchanging one talent for another, more potent selection.[BR][BR]

    <Description>[H3]Maker's Mark[h3]
The greatest of crafters and artisans are known the galaxy over, and their work is easily recognizable by any expert in such matters. Whether it is an actual stamp bearing the name of the creator or the creator's company, a special feature, or an inimitable quirk of design, such a maker's mark is a sign of quality and distinctiveness. [P]

In [B]Age of Rebellion[b], a maker's mark represents an Engineer character's unique approach to crafting a particular variety of item. Any Engineer character may develop a maker's mark, with the GM's permission. Once a character has reached an appropriate point in the game's narrative, based on the charater's experience with and success as a crafter, the player and GM can work together to decide the form that Engineer's mark takes in game, as well as the mechanical benefits. [P]

Even within a given specialization, an Engineer might demonstrate truly remarkable proficiency in a narrower field. Whether a Mechanic whose modified blasters are the envy of fighters the galaxy over or a Droid Specialist whose astromechs are known for unerring accuracy, an Engineer with proven expertise is a truly exceptional craftsman in a narrow area of specialty. This stellar proficiency In turn brings rewards. [P]
Proven expertise is available to Engineer PCs at the GM's discretion. In order to qualify, the character must demonstrate in-game exceptional ability in designing or constructing a specific type of equipment or in carrying out a particular task. The GM and player should work together to define this area of expertise and sum it up as briefly as possible. For instance, a character might have proven expertise in blasters, starfighters, weapon attachments, or battlefield repairs.

    <Name>Reputation</Name>
    <Description>[H3]Reputation[h3]
Reputation is not a universal resource PCs simply accumulate. Rather, it rises and falls within different spheres in which the PCs operate based on the choices that they make. Renown and notoriety both have benefits and drawbacks, and the GM can use the tools here to help show the lasting impacts of the PCs’ actions.[P]
If GM wants to use reputations, he should begin by identifying a handful of spheres important to his campaign. These can be institutional, cultural, or geographic, based on the scope of the campaign. Spheres of influence can be as broad or narrow as the campaign demands. Some possible examples include:[BR]
• Mos Eisley[BR]
• The Flutt Kajidics[BR]
• The FHydian Way[BR]
• Corellia[BR]
• Core Worlds Fligh Society[BR]
• Soldiers of the Empire and Rebel Alliance[BR]
• Pirates in Flutt Space[BR]
• Promise Colony[BR]
• The Corporate Sector[P]
At the end of a plot arc or adventure, if the PCs were publicly associated with a major positive event (setting a new record for a smuggling route, saving a town from pirates, slaying a dangerous beast), the GM can increase the level of their Reputation by 1 in the relevant spheres. On the other hand, if the PCs were publicly associated with a major negative event (betraying and killing a Hutt crime lord, performing a destructive heist, causing massive collateral damage), the GM could decrease the level of their Reputation by 1 in the affected spheres.

    <Description>[H3]Ally[h3]
Allies are individuals who have benefited from the Warrior's actions. They can come from a variety of backgrounds, and each has a life and job separate from the Warrior. Most allies feel as though they owe the Warrior a favor, and they are willing to help as best they can in times of need. [P]
Allies can serve as a combined knowledge base for a Warrior. Once per session, the Warrior can ask an ally, either in person or via a comlink or other method of long-distance communication, to make a single Knowledge, Skulduggery, or Streetwise check on the Warrior's behalf. Depending on the ally, the GM may permit any Knowledge skill or restrict the ally to one or more Knowledge skills. The time it takes for the Warrior to receive an answer depends on the method of communication, and generating [TH] on the check can delay the answer.

    <Description>[H3]Apprentice[h3]
The Warrior might attract a particularly enthusiastic follower who becomes an apprentice. This NPC hopes to learn the Warrior's martial skills and help others as the Warrior helped them. Taking on an apprentice can provide a Warrior with great roleplaying moments, and the student's character arc might culminate in running a school for other students hoping to learn the Warrior's chosen form of combat. While some Warriors find annoyance with an apprentice's constant admiration and pestering, apprentices are also useful for invoking titles Warriors are too humble to bring up themselves.[P] 
Once per session, for an entire combat encounter. the apprentice can join the Warrior in combat. Rather than having an adversary profile and taking individual turns in combat, the apprentice fights in unison with the Warrior, augmenting the PC's combat checks or aiding the PC's defense. The GM can spend [TH] on any combat check the Warrior makes to have the apprentice incapacitated for the rest of the encounter or otherwise defeated, and the benefits of the apprentice end immediately. A Warrior can benefit from only one apprentice at a time.

Followers are inspired by the Warrior's example. and they do their best to aid the PC's efforts. They come from a variety of backgrounds, but many have left their old life behind to follow and help the Warrior. While not all are prepared to engage in combat, many are trying to learn and consider the Warrior their instructor. Followers possess a diverse set of skills from their lives before meeting the Warrior, and they are more than willing to help in any way they can.[P]
Followers often have a degree of technical training from a past career. Once per session, they can make a single Computers, Mechanics, or Medicine check on behalf of the Warrior, at the GM's discretion. These checks generally require the followers to be on-site; the Warrior can't receive aid by comlink as with an ally benefit. Followers must physically follow the Warrior and be present to assist. This can pose some logistical challenges for a party. Followers also take up much of a Warrior's free time, as each hopes to learn how to fight straight from their hero.

    <Description>[H3]School[h3]
Many Warriors place a premium on passing on their skills. Training an apprentice can happen in the field, but training an entire student body requires a facility and a faculty. Warriors who establish a formal training facility provide their followers, allies, and apprentice a safe place in which to shut out distractions and focus on training. [P]
Schools can grow over time. They might start out as a small local gym where students can exercise, spar, and work with training droids or in simulators. They can evolve into more respected institutions with better facilities and a reputation in the galaxy. Eventually, they might even turn into massive training compounds or a network of smaller gyms. GMs should work with players when they establish a school to discuss their goals for it. [P]
Mechanically, schools improve all checks made by allies, apprentices, and followers. This bonus improves every check they make that is related to the benefits they provide the Warrior. Schools are often run by a Warrior's first apprentice, after the apprentice reaches the Experienced Apprentice tier.

[H4]DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AND GALLANTRY[h4]
Awards granted by Alliance High Command for distinguished service or conspicuous gallantry are the most prestigious decorations Alliance personnel can wear. They show that the recipient is an exceptional soldier, pilot, or crewperson, or has performed some spectacular act of bravery or self-sacrifice that requires special recognition. While these medals provide no mechanical benefits, Game Masters may, at their discretion, grant a player who has earned one of these vaunted awards some small bonus to social interaction skills when dealing with other military personnel.

The number of common military and civilian decorations bestowed by the Alliance is truly staggering.

Below are some of the more ubiquitous decorations found throughout the Alliance.
