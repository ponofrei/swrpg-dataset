Interplanetary conflict inevitably brings battles to the upper atmosphere and the void of space. Capital ships play a prominent role in these battles, but large wings of starfighters are a vital part of every conflict. These specialized ships exploit their smaller profile and variations in armament to avoid detection while occupying a variety of roles. Military transports deploy from capital ships—often through active war zones in the company of starfighter screens—to deliver troops and equipment to a planet's surface, where clones can engage the enemy.
Every Clone Soldier has the rudimentary knowledge required to pilot repulsorlift vehicles, walkers, and starfighters. However, basic skills alone are inadequate for success in a combat environment. To address this, some Clone Soldiers receive additional training in the Clone Pilot specialization and are inducted into the Republic Navy branch of the Grand Army of the Republic.
Clone Pilots receive Gunnery, Mechanics, Piloting (Planetary), and Piloting (Space) as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. A degree of familiarity with these skills is vital for any Clone Soldier to survive as a starfighter pilot. While any battlefield is profoundly dangerous, the vacuum of space adds significant risks that are not present during typical planetary conflicts. Additional training mitigates some of those dangers but can never completely eliminate them.[P]
Clone Pilots serve as members of a squadron under the command of a Clone Officer, who has also mastered the skills of a pilot. A squadron is typically assigned a particular type of craft, although this can change based on mission requirements. Clone Pilots are sometimes reassigned to other squadrons in which they are expected to fly other craft. Consequently, their training includes exposure to a range of starfighters, speeders, and walkers.
