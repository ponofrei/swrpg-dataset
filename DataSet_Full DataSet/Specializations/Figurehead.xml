  <Description>[H4]Figurehead - Charismatic Leaders[h4]

Figureheads generally come from civilian backgrounds
and aren’t necessarily a part of the Alliance
Military’s chain of command. They rely on their reputations,
political connections, and charisma to accomplish
their goals. Though their aims might not align
perfectly with those of the other Commander careers,
the respect they command due to their political legacies
ensures that they continue
to be a motivating factor in both
political and military circles within
the Rebel Alliance. Examples of
Figureheads in the Rebel Alliance
include Mon Mothma and
the late Bail Organa, as well
as his adopted daughter,
Princess Leia
Organa.
[P]Figureheads receive [B]Cool, Leadership, Negotiation,[b]
and [B]Knowledge (Core Worlds)[b] as additional career
skills. If this is the character’s starting specialization,
the player may choose two of these skills and gain
one free rank in each without spending experience.
Many Commanders focus their social aptitudes on
skills that help them get people to do what they want,
such as Coercion. Figureheads, on the other hand, get
what they want through subtle manipulations, preferring
to persuade those under their command to do
what must be done.
[P]Much of a Figurehead’s repertoire consists of personal
fortitude, as bearing the hopes and fears of
their people is a Figurehead’s primary focus. Cool
is especially important, for it allows a Figurehead
to gain the trust and admiration of subordinates.
Figureheads’ demeanor must inspire those who
admire them, allowing their followers to overcome
their personal qualms—including fear—in order to
strike a blow against the Galactic Empire. Whether
this inspiring quality applies to a Figurehead’s physical
appearance depends on the character’s personal
style; many Figureheads have turned their scars and
the wounds they’ve suffered into inspirational messages
all their own.
[P]Figureheads who take a more active role in resisting
the Empire's oppression often do so through
leadership and inspiration. The confidence and
know-how of a trained leader is much more convincing
under fire than good looks and a pithy slogan.
Seeing action in combat also serves to bolster a Figurehead’s
reputation within the military, as Figureheads
not only know how to “talk the talk,” but to
“walk the walk” as well.
[P]As many Figureheads got their start in the political
arenas of the Core Worlds, it’s no surprise that most of
them know a thing or two about where they’ve come
from. Not only do they have extensive knowledge of
Core World political systems—including those of the
now-defunct Republic—but they also have information
about which Core Worlds systems are more or less
opposed to the Empire. Such information can be valuable
when deciding which systems to approach for help
or determining where a group of Rebels in a pinch might
be able to seek refuge.</Description>
