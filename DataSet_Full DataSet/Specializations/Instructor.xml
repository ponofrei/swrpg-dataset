  <Description>[H4]Instructor - Head of the Class[h4]

When it comes to showing the untested masses of the galaxy how to fight and win, an excellent
Instructor is crucial. After all, handing untrained enlistees
a blaster and sending them into the thick of combat
is a good way of getting them killed before they’ve
even had a chance to make a difference. Instructors
ensure that no one is sent to fight the Empire before
they’re ready, preventing Rebel blood from being
spilled in vain. Though their own role is primarily one of
support, Instructors must also be proficient in the skills
they impart to their students, making them effective
soldiers when they are inevitably called to fight.
[P]Instructors receive [B]Discipline. Medicine,
Ranged (Heavy),[b] and [B]Knowledge
(Education)[b] as additional career
skills. If this is the character’s starting
specialization, the player may
choose two of these skills and gain
one free rank in each without
spending experience. Not all
Instructors need to be combat-ready, but most of those
employed by the Rebel Alliance
have, by necessity, at
least some combat capability available to them. An Instructor must also have
enough empathy to identify
with students and to discern which
areas they excel in and where they
require improvement.
[P]It takes intense control to maintain
a professional demeanor and
concentrate on the job at hand,
both for Instructors and for their
recruits. Order must be maintained
both on and off the field
so that would-be soldiers aren’t
cowed by the sights, sounds,
and demands of combat. Imparting
discipline to their students,
especially if they’ve never held a
weapon, is crucial if Instructors
want to see them survive the rigors
of warfare.
[P]Some Instructors are also well versed in the use of
Medicine. Not only is first aid a skill that every soldier
should possess, but injuries occur all too often during
intensive training. Passing on the basics of Medicine to
recruits ensures that trainees can save not only their
comrades, but themselves as well. If training recruits
to use medpacs and synthflesh to patch up wounds is
all an Instructor is assigned to do, then Medicine may
very well be that character’s primary focus.
[P]Every soldier must learn how to shoot, so many
Instructors are also accomplished marksmen.
Trainees not only need to know
how to fire their weapon with the
intention of hitting the enemy,
but they must also learn how to
care for and maintain it under
battlefield conditions. Drilling
recruits with a blaster comprises
the basics of infantry training. Initial training is with
an unloaded weapon, to get
recruits comfortable with carrying
it, used to its weight, and
vaguely uncomfortable when it’s
not within reach. Many hours of port-arms and awareness
 drills are held before a recruit
is allowed to fire a fully charged
blaster downrange at a target.
[P]Though it seems to go without
saying, Instructors must be well
educated. Being skilled at conveying their knowledge to their
students is an important part of
their job description. When integrated with a Rebel cell or combat
unit, Instructors can be a benefit
to everyone they serve with.
As teachers, they must be able to
demonstrate the correct way to
do something under any circumstances.
It’s highly unlikely that
they wouldn’t be able to show
everyone a trick or two when the
chips are down.</Description>
