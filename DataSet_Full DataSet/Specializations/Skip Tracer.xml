  <Description>[H4]Skip Tracer[h4]
Not all debts ned to be settled with blasters. Sometimes, a Bounty Hunter just needs to do some legwork, find a target, and get that individual to pay what is owed with a few well-chosen words. This is the specialty of Skip Tracers, who take on commissions to seek out people with unpaid debts from clients who wish to have items returned, cash given back, or recompense paid in some other way. Most Skip Tracers prefer to keep their guns holstered for the whole job, and try their utmost to avoid causing negotiations with their targets to break down explosively. Property destruction and medical bills cut into the commission, after all. Of course, as most Skip Tracers know all too well, things rarely go so smoothly. More often, the Skip Tracer ends up needing to apply pressure somewhere along the line, whether this takes the form of gaining leverage on the target or delivering a threat of violenceâ€”at the hands of the client or otherwise.
[P]In addition to the Bounty Hunter's eight career skills, the Skip Tracer receives [B]Cool[b], [B]Knowledge (Underworld)[b], [B]Negotiation[b], and [B]Skulduggery[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the Skip Tracer may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.
[P]All Bounty Hunters have access to investigative abilities through access to Perception and Streetwise as career skills, but Skip Tracers are particularly strong at this aspect of the job. Several Skip Tracer talents are especially useful when backed by a high Cunning or Intelligence; Improved Street Smarts and Reconstruct the Scene let Skip Tracers find leads on even the scantest of evidence, and Bypass Security can help these investigators reach secured locations where their targets might be hiding. Through dedication and keen insight, Skip Tracers can locate and pursue a target across nearly any distance, which makes them ideal for finding people who wish to avoid notice.
[P]Skip Tracer also benefit from an investment in their Presence, as once they find their marks, they must convince them to part with what is owed. Several of the Skip Tracer's talents, such as Good Cop and Nobody's Fool make it difficult of targets to get the better of Skip Tracers in negotiations, and ensure that they recover the client's property. If matters do become ugly, however, Skip Tracers are not defenseless: Hard-Boiled and Rapid Recovery allow Skip Tracers to doggedly pursue their quarry even after taking a beating, and Soft Spot lets them slip a finishing blow through at exactly the right moment, even against a tough opponent.</Description>
