  <Description>[H4]Strategist - In For The Long Haul[h4]

Strategists are responsible for forming the core directives
used in the war against the Empire. Rather
than focusing on individual battles, they analyze the
big picture—both what has happened and what is
bound to happen should their plans bear fruit. They
also monitor the effectiveness of logistics to ensure
that military units aren’t too thinly spread or sparsely
supplied to be effective. Anything that might change
the tide of battle concerns them, and they must possess
sharp minds and keen
wits to keep all the variables
under control.
[P]Strategists receive [B]Computers, Cool, Vigilance,[b]
and [B]Knowledge (Warfare)[b] as additional career
skills. If this is the character’s starting specialization,
the player may choose two of these skills and gain
one free rank in each without spending experience.
Though they rarely possess direct command of armies
or units, Strategists are expected to arrange the highlevel
details of the operations and battles the Rebel
military must participate in. A Strategist must also be
incredibly detail-oriented, as forgetting a minor item
when planning a planetary strike could lead to the
deaths of thousands of Alliance troops.
[P]Strategists must be able to keep their cool. Viewing
the Galactic Civil War from such a lofty vantage
point can cause even the most tranquil individuals to
break under pressure. In fact, the conflict at hand is
so vast and complex that it can be difficult to digest
it all, even in multiple sittings. Keeping a cool head
also allows the Strategist an opportunity to examine
an enemy’s movements in order to discern whether
or not it is attempting a feint or a full-fledged assault.
Imperial commanders are cunning tacticians, and
their ruses can be disastrous if they aren’t seen for
what they are before it’s too late.
[P]Obviously, successful Strategists must know the
ins and outs of warfare. Being aware of their enemies’
capabilities, as well as those of their own troops, is
vital to planning a successful campaign. In addition,
possessing intimate knowledge of wars both past
and present allows Strategists to learn from
the lessons of their predecessors, or to
call up a little-used tactic to catch the
Empire off guard.
[P]Though a Strategist may
seem like an odd choice for
the typical Alliance cell, the
knowledge and keen insight
such a character brings to a
party are well worth having.
With a little combat training, a
Strategist can act as a secondary combatant
while watching the battlefield for
signs of opportunity or disaster. Given their
potential training in both Cool and Vigilance,
it’s unlikely that a Strategist will be
caught unawares when things turn ugly.</Description>
