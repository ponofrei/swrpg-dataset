  <Description>[H4]Vanguard - Unrelenting Onlaught[h4]
Vanguards are first to the fight, Soldiers skilled in taking point and taking charge. While they generally do
not command in the traditional sense, their preferred
mode of combat is to hit hard and fast, and thus allies
tend to fall in behind them, if only so that they are
not left behind. This means that Vanguards shoulder a
great deal of the risk in battle, but most would rather
take a blaster bolt than let a squadmate be shot. As a
result of taking so many hits over the course of their
military careers, the Vanguards who survive tend to be
extremely tough.
[P]Vanguards have [B]Athletics[b], [B]Cool[b], [B]Vigilance[b], and
[B]Resilience[b] as additional career skills. If this is a character's starting specialization, he may choose two of
these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Having both Cool and
Vigilance means that Vanguards are extremely unlikely
to flinch or hesitate when the shots start flying, regardless of whether
they are launching an ambush or reacting
to an unexpected move. Athletics reflects the
physical acumen of Vanguards, while Resilience
stems from the long history of hits such characters
have likely taken.
[P]On battlefields often dominated by massive walkers, sudden starfighter strikes, and orbital bombardments, standing still in the open can be a death sentence, and Vanguards know it. Rather than hunkering down and hoping to avoid the worst, Vanguards take
the battle directly to the enemy, seizing the in itiative to end the battle before their foes even realize
that it has begun. They tend to favor rapid strikes,
armored assaults, and shipboard actions that leave
the enemy reeling and unable to bring its arm or to
bear. So long as they keep moving, their logic goes,
the enemy cannot hope to pin them down. Barriers
to their entry, from blast doors to bunkers, are som ething to be smashed so that they can move on to the
next target. The Moving Target talent is particularly
useful when keeping m obile to stay alive, and makes
a Vanguard with the drop on the enemy extremely
difficult to bring down.
[P]Off the field of battle, Vanguards are frequently
quick to action as well Hesitation on the battlefield
is often fatal, and many Vanguards apply this mentality to their other activities, trying to keep opponents.</Description>
