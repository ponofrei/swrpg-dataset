  <Description>[H4]Clone[h4]
Most citizens of the Galactic Republic regard clones as being synonymous with the Grand Army of the Republic. Considered to be as faceless, identical, ones emotionless as the members of droid army they fight, clones know of their origins and purpose. Rather than struggle against their destiny, most Republic clones fully accept their engineered life, celebrating their bonds of purpose and background. 
[P]From a certain point of view, the clones of the Grand Army of the Republic have the strongest ethical fabric in the galaxy. They fight for a greater good: the safety and protection of the Galactic Republic. They willingly sacrifice themselves for - their brothers-in-arms. The majority would never even consider betraying those ideals. What other sentient can say that?
[P][B]Physiology:[b] Physically identical, and based on the genetic template of bounty hunter Jango Fett, clones can be considered standard humans-though they age at a vastly accelerated rate as a necessity for the creation and sustainment of the fighting force. When decanted, almost all clones share Jango Fett’s black hair, dark-brown eye color, and olive skin tone, Some genetic variants exist, although most are confined to Kamino as case studies-or embarrassments.
[P][B]Society:[b] Genetically tailored to obedience and trained for loyalty, clones develop a sense of family with their peers and many of their commanders, who are like their brothers and wise elders. Even though Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters serve as general and high-ranked commanders, shaping and deeply affecting the clones' lives, clones don’t consider them family. for example, even though it could be argued that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas was responsible for the clones' existence, the clones instead consider the near-mythologized Jango Fett to be their father figure. 
[P]Despite the common public perception, clones of the Grand Army do have individual traits and personalities. Most have individual nicknames, and even clone commanders identify each of their soldiers with particular skills and talents. After all, if one clone soldier has shown competence in an ability, such as demolitions, his commander has to be able to identify and order him to perform that task. As sentient beings, the clones recognize not only their similarities to but also their differences from each other; despite their rigorous military training, they experience unintentional social pressures from their peers both to conform and to stand out. A clone soldier who takes on a reckless—but successful—action gets called "reckless" by his peers. This gives him a reputation for recklessness, which, strangely enough, might compel the clone to undertake further brash actions. The intensity of war exacerbates this tendency, so the older and more seasoned a clone gets, the more personality quirks he develops. 
[P]Of course, the rare clones who escape the military program accrue a haphazard education, usually focused on survival Nevertheless, they retain many of their military habits. Despite their personality quirks and personal beliefs, these runaway clones still refer to their peers as "brothers."
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] All clones come from Kamino, and official Republic documents likewise record it as the homeworld of each clone. Like any natural species, drones feel a great regard for their homeworld and are fiercely protective of it. 
[P]As an engineered people in service to the Republic, clones of the Grand Army tend to see their fellow soldiers as family, dead comrades as ancestors, new recruits as descendants, and their ships or barracks as their places of work. Clones generally have little reason to return to Kamino, yet the word “home” conjures thoughts of the planet, especially after the Separatists' attempted invasion.
[P][B]Language:[b] Clones speak Basic. the language of the Galactic Republic. While they have the capability to learn new languages, military life restricts them for the most part to practical military knowledge. Continued exposure to other cultures may give them time to learn, but not enough to be fluent. Time in the field tends to pepper a clone's language with military jargon and slang, such as “clankers” or "rollers" (for droids), “poppers” (grenades), and “shinies” (rookies), and acronyms such as BLOB, which means “big lump on board"—or useless civilian— and FIDO, which means “forget it, drive on.”
[P][B]Life under the Republic:[b] Most Republic clones don't interact often with the citizens they have sworn to protect. They may speak with Jedi or with Republic government officials, but mostly in the context of receiving orders or mission briefings. Clone troopers live a regimented life in military barracks at sector headquarters The Republic military even governs their recreation. scheduling games and competitions, both physical and intellectual. Study and additional learning focuses on combat tactics, strategy, military history, and leadership. The learning programs include courses on military and civilian ethics and law to emphasize patriotism, loyalty, and civil obedience rather than critical thinking or legal interpretation.</Description>
