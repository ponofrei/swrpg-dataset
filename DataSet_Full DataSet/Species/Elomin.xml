  <Description>[H4]Elomin[h4]
The Eloms and Elomin share similar names and the
same homeworld, but are physically and culturally
very different species. The Elomin are tall and exclusively bipedal, with physical traits similar to those of
other humanoid species in the galaxy. The Eloms are
shorter, stockier, and covered in fur, and have a large
head with widespread eyes. The Elomin were known
first to the rest of the galaxy, after Republic scouts first
made contact with the world. In fact, the surface dwelling Elomin were themselves ignorant of the Eloms'
existence until the former pursued extensive mining efforts and inadvertently crashed into the Eloms'
underground territories. The Elomin were not keen to
share their cold, dry world, but eventually yielded to
Republic pressure. The two species pursue a separate
existence from each other whenever possible.
[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Elomin are tall humanoids with thin heads crowned by four distinctive horns. Away from their homeworld, they are occasionally mistaken for Zabraks, who are more common across the galaxy.
The Elomin have large, pointed ears and nearly solidcolored, bright eyes of a wide variety of hues. Their skin
color ranges from black to brighter shades of red. Their
fingers have small sharp, claw-like nails.
[P]Despite long involvement in the Republic and the
Empire, many Elomin prefer working on their own or
with other Elomin whenever possible. These xenophobic tendencies also play into their dealings with the
Eloms. However, in spite of their insular societal tendencies, many individual Elomin are driven by a thirst
for knowledge that takes them into the wider galaxy.
[P][B]Society:[b] The Elomin live in politically divided
lands, with countries and cities. They actively participated in galactic society and were members of the
Republic long before their discovery of the Elom. Joining the former Republic advanced Elomin technology
to a very advanced space age in a short time. The Elomin pursue patterns of logic and puzzle out the ways
of the universe. They are capable of reordering their
thinking when presented with enough evidence, but
they can stubbornly hold to previous ideas and ignore
new discoveries or advances until it is overwhelming.
This dogged adherence to a well-established order
cemented the Elomin stance after the initial discovery of the Eloms. The decree recognizing the Eloms’
sentience forced the Elomin to formally acknowledge
the reality. It has taken years of Imperial abuse for
the Elomin to acknowledge that they now must turn
to their underground neighbors for assistance so that
both species can survive.
[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Elom is a frigidly cold desert world.
Elomin settlements and cities dot the surface. Their
cities are as technologically advanced as those found
on most Imperial worlds. The planet is best known
as a source of lommite, which is used in the manufacture of transparisteel windows for starships and
other craft. Originally an industry contracted out to
offworld mining operators, it is now controlled by the
Empire. Whereas the original agreements tried to
preserve and respect the planet’s environment, the
Imperials place efficiency and production well above
local concerns. The steady, continued destruction
of vast areas of their world trouble and anger both
the Elomin and Eloms. Both have been powerless to
slow it down, let alone bring it to a halt.
[P]Elomin cities and towns are clustered in the more
hospitable environments around the harsher deserts. Mining operations are farther afield, given that
mines close to the oldest cities were depleted long
ago. Imperial interests and operations focus on the
mines. Imperials in the cities have no qualms about
forcing Elomin into service as miners. Banishment
to the mines is a common and cruel form of punishment for anyone who opposes the Empire or offends
the wrong Imperial official. However, reasons for
hauling someone away are just a formality, and the
Elomin understand that anyone could be next.
[P]The Empire has largely ignored the Eloms’ deep
cities, located far below the planet’s surface. The
cities have varying levels of technology, depending
on the location and even the neighborhood within a
settlement. Most advanced technology is imported
from the Elomin and sometimes beyond. Many cities, remote caverns, and dwellings are connected
by natural and Elom-constructed tunnels. The tunnels range in size from those requiring single file passage, to more sophisticated varieties with paved floors and reinforced roofs. Some are large enough to allow for speeder traffic. Many of the cities and tunnels are so far underground that the Imperials have difficulty detecting them, let alone setting up surveillance. The cities are largely home to just the Eloms. However, some Elomin reused from Imperial mining efforts have been allowed to live among the Eloms indefinitely.
[P][B]Language (Elomin):[b] The Elomin speak a language
much closer to Basic than the Eloms, and most Elomin struggle to learn the language of their neighbors The few Elomin who make the effort to learn
Elom are usually those who end up living with the
Eloms after rescue from the mines or seek out Elom
enclaves to learn more about them.  </Description>
