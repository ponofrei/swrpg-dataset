Each new path offers him a chance to learn something new about himself, and each challenge he faces gives him insight into what he is really capable of. For many Explorers, this is a journey that will only end with their deaths...and possibly not even then.</Description>

Some seek out secrets at the behest of others, preferring to stay out of the direct conflicts caused by the possession of them, while others happily wield the secrets they've uncovered as weapons for their own pursuits. As powerful and wealth inducing as secrets can be, however, they can also be incredibly dangerous, many beings will kill to maintain important secrets, and many others will kill to obtain those who discover them in the first place.</Description>

Eons of conflict caused vast storehouses of knowledge to be lost amid the rubble of destroyed cities, derelict ships, and abandoned space stations. Intrepid Explorers are the miners of that knowledge, bringing it back into the light of day for all to benefit from. Archaeologists are naturally inclined to search for knowledge, as are Fringers and Traders.</Description>

Credits are credits, but resources drive the economies of every system, as well as the Empire itself. Raw materials power the Imperial war machine, which is ever expanding. So, too, does the burgeoning Rebellion crave important resources as it struggles to build up some semblance of an organized resistance. Of course. there are also the millions of businesses, factions, and entrepreneurs who seek one source or another of some special kind of resource in order to enhance their trade position and power. Those who can uncover such sources—Scouts are particularly sought after for such work—can make very good money.</Description>

Billions of scientists, engineers, and inventors throughout the galaxy have been creating wonders of technology for thousands of years. Much of it has been lost due to war or merely the fall of a civilization. Other scientific marvels manifest on a daily basis, unknown to the galaxy at large. Clever Explorers seek out these technological Discoveries to bring to the general population, though usually through either corporate or Imperial channels. Fringers and Traders are most likely to have such a focus, though Drivers will obviously be interested in any vehicular technology they can uncover.</Description>

Explorers know their way around the galaxy better than anyone. They know where the hidden places are, as well as the pathways and Interstellar routes that go unknown to all others. As such, Explorers are often called upon (either by others or by their own code) to seek out those who have become lost. Some seek to be lost, while many find they would no longer know the way home even if they wished to return. Many are unable to escape their current circumstances, needing to be found and liberated.

Perhaps he wants what he's owed, fair and square, or maybe dreams of winning big in a sabacc game. In any case, he is in it for the money. Smuggling can be very lucrative if he goes about it the right way and has luck on his side. There is always the chance, particularly in illegal dealings, that the employer won't want to pay out such cases, the Smuggler with the Credits Motivation does everything he can to claim his due.</Description>

      [H4]Apprentice[h4]
Some Consulars are focused less on their own growth and more on the personal growth of others. These Consulars see great potential in a student and hope to guide that student on a path in keeping with their own ideals.</Description>

      [H4]Knowledge[h4]
The galaxy is in a state of turmoil and tyranny thanks to the Galactic Empire, which exercises absolute control over the flow of information. Many Consulars realize that breaking the restriction of information and sharing that knowledge with those around them are the only ways to check the darker forces in the galaxy.</Description>

      [H4]Wisdom/Experience[h4]
Most Consulars aspire to be wise leaders or advisors, enabling those in their orbit to lead happier, fuller lives. Unlike knowledge, wisdom comes only from doing, by experiencing life in all its challenges. Those seeking wisdom often search for those who have it and, more importantly, have a zeal for experiencing, seeing, and trying new things to broaden their perspective. </Description>

      [H4]Allies[h4]
Consulars know that achieving a lasting peace can only happen when lines of communication between various factions are open to diplomacy. Growing and strengthening friendly, diplomatic connections between groups is a way to ensure they keep talking to each other and only engage in violence as a last resort. This might mean bringing a small community closer together, overseeing diplomatic negotiations between warring planets, or bringing new resistance movements into the Rebel Alliance fold.</Description>

      [H4]The Jedi Order[h4]
Many Consulars believe the only way to restore peace and harmony to the galaxy is to rebuild the Jedi Order. This means not only locating and training other Force sensitives, but also convincing those in hiding to do the same. It can also mean helping those fallen to the dark side become Jedi once again. Consulars with this Motivation may wish to spread the ideals of the Jedi Order, even to those who cannot touch the Force.</Description>

Life itself creates the Force, and places teeming with life tend to be strong in the Force. PCs with this Motivation hope to see life flourish everywhere and do their part to help life along. This might mean using their unique skills to stop war, plague, or famine. This Motivation can also express itself in smaller ways, such as cultivating a garden or planting seeds of nearly extinct species wherever the Consular goes.</Description>

Trust in the Force, and it often provides its servants with all they might need. The solution to any puzzle is often a matter of obtaining the right perspective or finding the right person for the job. Consulars looking to grow their circle of friends know that being kind and generous to others is its own reward and often brings kindness and generosity back tenfold. Though Jedi were warned against attachment, most had many friends from their travels.</Description>

It is a dark time for the galaxy, when the Empire crushes resistance and those who are different without care. In this era of oppression, many Consulars know that the best they can offer the downtrodden is the hope that one day things can get better. These PCs have visions of hope spreading across the galaxy, and seek to inspire even the lowliest beggar or prisoner to hope again.</Description>

For many Consulars, the Force is like water, flowing between the life that creates it and the Consular, connecting them. For most, this flow of energy is a mere trickle, but with effort and time, it can flow like a powerful river. PCs with the Force Connection Growth Motivation seek new means to expand their connection to the Force, certain that as their connection grows, the means to bring peace to the galaxy becomes clearer.</Description>
