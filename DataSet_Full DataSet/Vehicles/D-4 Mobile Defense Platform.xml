  <Description>[H3]D-4 Mobile Defense Platform[h3]
[P]Incom developed this heavy landspeeder as a heavy response defense vehicle for urban crisis zones, and many militaries have adopted it for rescue operations. The vehicle can quickly deliver a squad of troops to a combat zone, and then provide cover and light fire support without the necessity of setting up a dedicated defense perimeter. In fierce combat zones, a D-4 can be rapidly redeployed across the front lines during the course of a battle to provide its shields and firepower wherever most needed. The sight of a D-4 zooming toward a zone of heavy engagement has been often been more of a welcome sight for beleaguered forces and a massive frustrations for attackers hoping to finally make a breakthrough.</Description>

      <MiscDesc>[B]Defensive Platform[b]: As a maneuver, the driver may use the craft's shields to create a defensive dome (or withdraw it).  Reduce defense in all zones to 0, but the vehicle, and each other vehicle and character within short range (personal) counts as having Defense 3 against attacks from outside the dome.</MiscDesc>
