  <Description>[H3]MC80A [I]Home One[i] Type Heavy Star Cruiser[h3]

A broadly defined class of large, purpose-built Mon
Calamari battleships, the Home One type ships are
among the Alliance Navy’s most powerful capital ships.
Named for Admiral Ackbar’s flagship, Home One, the
vessels grouped into this class are larger and, overall,
more powerful than the Liberty type ships more commonly
seen in Rebel battle groups. Like their smaller
cousins, ships of the Home One type began operation
as civilian craft, mostly passenger liners or deep-space
exploration vessels. Since these vessels were built in
different shipyards for different roles and with different
systems requirements, they varied widely in their
equipment, fit, and finish. As they were brought into
military service, they were given extensive refits at the
Mon Calamari Shipyards that included stiffening their
keels, adding armor, upgrading sensors and shields,
converting internal spaces into hangars, upgrading
launch facilities providing berthing for more crew and
troops, and adding more powerful weapon systems.
These refits also brought a certain amount of commonality
to each vessel, allowing them to be grouped into a
single type with Home One as its lead vessel.
[P]Similar in size, strength, and role to the Imperial
Navy’s Imperial //-class Star Destroyers, the Home
One type is quite an imposing vessel. While ships
of this type still vary slightly in size and shape, they
do share many common design cues and possess
the same quasi-organic look as other Mon Calamari-
built ships. Each vessel in the class has a long,
cylindrical hull tapering to a point at the bow and flaring into a flat fantail at the stern. Weapon batteries and sensor arrays are placed around the hull at strategic points, protected by long, armored blisters. Two massive hanger bays are mounted amidships, and thrust is provided by four massive m8.0-StarDrive and six M4.5-StarDrive ion drives mounted astern below the fantail. While the addition of the heavier hill plates and improved armor does not spoil the ships' graceful lines completely, it does give them a bulky, almost humpbacked appearance.
[P]Precious few of these ships are currently in service with the Alliance Navy, and High command jealously guards those that are. They are rarely deployed without a heavy escort of smaller cruisers and carriers, and orders are typically given that they are to stay at the rear of an engagement, protected from enemy fire. These orders don't stop bold commanders like Ackbar from running their ships directly into Imperial Navy formations, however. Their powerful weapons and large fighter wings can quickly turn the tide of a battle and their mere presence serves to inspire Alliance personnel, thanks to the grit and bravery of their Mon Calamari crew.</Description>
