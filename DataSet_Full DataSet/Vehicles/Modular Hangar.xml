  <Description>[H3]HNG F-104 Modular Hangar[h3]

Similar in construction
to the L-120 modular motor pool, the F-104
modular hangar provides ample space for starfighters
or airspeeders and all of the equipment needed
to maintain and repair these near-priceless military
assets. When assembled, a modular hangar can
hold starfighters or airspeeders with silhouettes
that together total 12 or less.

While any mods or benefits are per the official source, the actual vehicle stats are an interpretation only and are not official.  Feel free to modify them if you think any changes are required.[i]</Description>
