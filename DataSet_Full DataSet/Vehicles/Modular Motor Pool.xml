  <Description>[H3]Fac L-120 Modular Motor Pool[h3]

A combination
garage, workshop, fabrication facility, and
shelter, the L-120 modular motor pool is designed to hold ground vehicles and their support
equipment. Little more than a large, lowceilinged
open space with a large door taking
up one long wall, the L-1 20 model modular
motor pool can hold a number of land vehicles
with silhouettes totaling no more than 6 and all
the tools, lifts, and heavy equipment required to
keep them in working order.
[P][I]Disclaimer: This is a piece of field equipment found in the Lead by Example Sourcebook.  It is created as a stationary "vehicle" because it is the most appropriate format.  While any mods or benefits are per the official source, the actual vehicle stats are an interpretation only and are not official.  Feel free to modify them if you think any changes are required.[i]</Description>
