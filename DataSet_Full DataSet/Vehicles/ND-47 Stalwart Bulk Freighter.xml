  <Description>[H3]ND-47 [I]Stalwart[i] Bulk Freighter[h3]
[P]Originally designed as an escort freighter for military naval groups, the ND-47 [I]Stalwart's[i] flat, thin design allows it to act as a makeshift shield for larger, more important vessels should their shields or armor become damaged. It's strong shields and tough armor plating also make it ideal for storing and transporting explosives and other military supplies, although this comes at the cost of offensive capabilities, of which the standard build has none. The freighter has also grown popular with captains who value toughness and durability over any other features in their ship. When not serving as an intentional shield, its design gives it a very narrow profile when either approaching or fleeing a target, making the vessel surprisingly hard to hit in such circumstances.</Description>
