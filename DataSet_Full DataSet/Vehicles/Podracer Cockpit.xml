Podracer cockpits, also known as gondolas, are what pass for a crew compartment on a Podracer. Constructed in a wide variety of styles and colors, they are typically small, open-topped affairs similar in size and shape to one or two person watercraft. They are equipped with a single pilot's chair and restraint harness, a simple avionics and sensor package, control systems for the engines, and low-output repulsorlift generator to provide lift and maneuverability.
[P]Podracer cockpits are simply a base upon which to build a custom Podracer. Cockpits come only with the listed systems and do not include engines, control cables, or any custom modifications.</Description>
