      [H3]Starwind Pleasure Yacht[h3]

The Starwind-class pleasure yacht was originally Kuat Drive Yards' attempt to create a competitor for Corellian Engineering Corporation's VT series. However, before the project even launched, KDY changed their mind and repackaged the ship as a luxury yacht. 

[P]The Starwind has been moderately successful on the market, although its redesign never quite shook its light freighter origins. The trident-shaped starship has two side sections mounted along each side of the ship's main hull. One side section houses the ship's crew quarters, the other contains a reasonable sized cargo hold. The central spar contains the bridge, guest quarters, stateroom, lounge, galley, conference room, holotheater, and even a zero-gee relaxation table. All in all, the ship has a thorough catalog of amenities, as well as substantial cargo space. 

[P]However, the Starwind's main drawback is that it costs as much as a light freighter and luxury yacht combined. This has kept sales lukewarm, although some particularly rich smuggler barons and criminal lords have taken the ship as their personal vessel/command center.</Description>
