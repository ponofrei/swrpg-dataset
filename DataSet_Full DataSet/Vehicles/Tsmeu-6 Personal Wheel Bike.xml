  <Description>[H3]Tsmeu-6 Personal Wheel Bike[h3]
[P]This large, single-wheel bike allows for a lone rider to quickly scope out an area, with its four additional legs deploying for continued movement over rough terrain, albeit at a reduced speed, when needed. While not fast enough for true speed enthusiasts, the bike has seen widespread use as a military reconnaissance vehicle. Though often armed with a light laser cannon, its deadliest weapon is the wheel itself, which can crush soldiers when moving at full velocity. Those who have seen a Tsmeu-6 bearing down on them at maximum velocity do not doubt its effectiveness.</Description>

As long as it is moving at speed 2 or lower, remove [SE][SE][SE] applied to piloting checks for navigational hazards (see page 246 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] Core Rulebook).</MiscDesc>
